While the physical destruction is visible, the mental health effects may not be as obvious. Understanding how disasters affect mental health can help people prepare, cope, and recover more effectively. “Natural disasters affect people in different ways,” says  Nomi Levy-Carrick, MD, MPhil , a Mass General Brigham psychiatrist. “A person’s reaction depends on many factors, including their past experiences, what is happening in their life at that moment, the nature of their exposure, and the support available to them as they rebuild. The sudden loss of control and uncertainty can be overwhelming, making it harder to cope in both the short and long term.” Dr. Levy-Carrick is vice-chair for clinical programs in the  Department of Psychiatry at Brigham and Women’s Hospital . She specializes in trauma-informed care in health care settings and in this article, she describes how natural disasters can affect mental health in many ways, from short-term stress to long-term challenges. Learning how to recognize and manage stress, get support, and heal over time can help with recovery. Natural disasters can happen quickly or develop over time. Some, like earthquakes and tornadoes, strike without warning, while others, like hurricanes, build up more slowly. No matter how they start, they can all cause serious damage and emotional distress. The most common types are: Living through a disaster can be overwhelming, and the emotional impact can last long after the event is over. Recognizing how disasters affect mental health can help people find ways to cope and recover. Psychological first aid (PFA) provides a structured way to support emotional recovery immediately after a disaster. It is like first aid for the brain and body after a disaster, says Dr. Levy-Carrick. It helps people feel safe, regain control, and connect with support. According to the  National Child Traumatic Stress Network,  PFA helps people feel less distressed after a disaster and supports their recovery by giving them tools to cope in both the short and long term. Right after a natural disaster, many people feel intense emotions. These may include: These short-term effects often lessen as people regain stability, but for some, they can lead to longer-term struggles. “We know that individuals who were most vulnerable before this disaster will be disproportionately impacted. As a community, and society, we want to think about ways to be equitable in our allocation of supports,” says Dr. Levy-Carrick.    “We also want to be trauma-informed about the ways we engage disaster survivors in many different settings,” she adds. “Asking ‘what happened to you?’ rather than ‘what’s wrong with you?’ can create an opportunity for understanding the experiences they feel are impacting them most. By understanding that what-how-why of an individual’s story, we can respond in ways that are more meaningful and impactful.” Nomi Levy-Carrick, MD, MPhil \nPsychiatrist \nMass General Brigham For many, the mental health effects of a natural disaster do not end once the immediate danger is gone. Some may experience: While support systems are essential to help people heal and move forward, some may need the help of mental health care providers as well. It is important to know that there are impactful, evidence-based interventions that can provide symptom relief.  Sometimes people need medication as well.  When emotions become overwhelming and get in the way of functioning and relationships, it’s important to seek out support. Shame and guilt can get in the way of that. It’s important disaster survivors understand that they shouldn’t worry alone and they can seek help if they are feeling stuck or in a dark place emotionally. For those feeling distress after a natural disaster, Dr. Levy-Carrick shares several steps that can help with recovery: The following resources provide helpful steps for managing stress: With the right support systems, mental healing is possible. Healing after a disaster takes time and support. Dr. Levy-Carrick explains that long-term recovery isn’t just about immediate emotional reactions, but also involves rebuilding routines, addressing ongoing mental health challenges, and ensuring people have access to the right resources. Support at the individual, family, and community level plays a key role in helping survivors regain stability and move forward. Long-term care can include: Providing long-term mental health support can help individuals and communities rebuild their lives after a disaster. “Surviving a natural disaster is just the beginning,” says Dr. Levy-Carrick. “When the level of destruction is as significant as in the recent LA Wildfires, we have to remember that recovery is a marathon, not a sprint.” “There will be different phases of response that relate to finding a new place to live, to work, and marking other milestones (birthdays, anniversaries) during this period of displacement,” she says. “Recognizing that the process is rarely linear, and letting go of an idea that life will resume exactly as it was before, allows for self-compassion and can provide a buffer to the waves of distress that can occur during the recovery period. There is an opportunity for post-traumatic growth, not just traumatic stress: sometimes just knowing that possibility can help people feel less fatalistic about what their mental health will be like in the future.” © 2025 Mass General Brigham Incorporated.

They’re not alone. Thousands of homeowners lose their property to natural disasters like hurricanes, floods and wildfires every year. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 73 separate billion-dollar disaster events caused more than $460 billion in damages between 2022 and 2024. And while many headlines focus on property losses and  insurance shortfalls , these events continue to impact the lives of those affected long after the media attention fades away. Just ask Mike Yurochko, CEO and founder of  Loti , a company that provides resources to help disaster victims during the recovery and rebuilding process. He was horrified when he watched a live stream of firefighters battling a blaze at his family home in Sonoma County, California, as the Kincade fire tore through the area in October 2019. Looters picking through what was left in the weeks after the fire was out didn’t help matters, either. Seeing your home damaged or destroyed — especially when you’re unable to intervene — takes a huge emotional toll, quickly followed by what Yurochko says is the “sheer fear of what happens next.” Homeowners insurance  is meant to help folks recover from these losses, but even if you’re fully insured, rebuilding could take years. In the meantime, you likely have more pressing matters to attend to. Finding safe housing is the immediate concern. Many insurance policies provide Additional Living Expenses (ALE) coverage, which can pay for temporary rent, pet boarding and other monthly costs for a specific amount of time. For many, it's a good idea to start filing insurance claims as soon as possible so you can start receiving payouts quickly. However, these are paid as reimbursements after the fact, so you’ll need to have cash on hand to cover costs for things like rent, food, and the replacement of personal items like clothes and toiletries. If you are under- or  self-insured , these expenses may have to come out of your emergency savings. You might also be on the hook for property taxes and mortgage payments if your lender isn’t offering some form of relief. “All around, there’s a lot of financial ripple effects there . . . that can affect your financial security down the road,” says Hanna Horvath, a certified financial planner who specializes in the psychological aspects of money management. Some help is already being offered to mortgage holders affected by the California fires. Over 270 financial institutions, from state-chartered lenders to national banks and credit unions, have agreed to offer a 90-day forbearance period on mortgage payments for homeowners in designated fire areas. The California legislature has also introduced a bill that would prohibit foreclosures and give homeowners the option of freezing mortgage payments without incurring a penalty for up to a year. For victims of catastrophic weather events like the California wildfires and Hurricane Helene, natural disasters pose a serious financial threat that can  take years to rebound from  — whether they are insured or not. For instance, depleting your savings could force you to go into debt, dip into your retirement savings or use funds earmarked for other purposes. Plus, you won’t have home equity to rely upon if you need cash. Equity loans and lines of credit rely on the appraised market value of your home. Fire-damaged or destroyed homes are likely to suffer a loss in resale value, and you may no longer have enough equity to take out a loan. Under these circumstances, many people turn to  disaster assistance funds  set up by state and federal governments and other charitable organizations like the American Red Cross or United Way. Or victims may set up GoFundMe pages for financial support. According to Kori Sassower, principal agent and founder of the  Kori Sassower  real estate team, homeowners whose properties have been damaged in a natural disaster generally have two choices: clean up and rebuild, or cut the losses and sell the land. In a 2021  poll  conducted by NPR, more than two-thirds of all homeowners said they would decide to stay and rebuild after a major disaster. After all, their home is the place they chose to raise a family or enjoy their golden years. But rebuilding, especially after a catastrophic event, can turn into a drawn-out process that drains your resources. Even though your property may have been insured, the claims process typically takes time. You likely won’t receive a lump sum payment but instead a series of payments as you rebuild your home and replace lost property. According to the  National Association of Insurance Commissioners , most claims are fully paid within 18 to 24 months. If you have losses covered under different policies, you will have to submit separate claims. Flood insurance, for example, is typically a separate policy from your homeowners insurance and has its own claims process. Having to submit claims under separate policies can extend the time you may have to wait. Under the best circumstances, a home takes six months to a year to build. However, after a natural disaster, everything from building supplies and appliances to contractors and labor will be in short supply. Because demand is heavier than usual, rebuilding could take several years. According to Yurochko, only 40% of the homes lost in the Kincade fire have been rebuilt. His own family home took three and a half years to rebuild. “We were paying for all those repairs and remediation out of our pocket,” Yurochko says. “We didn't get reimbursed from insurance until the very end.” During the time it may take to rebuild, you’ll be responsible for making mortgage and insurance payments, taxes, rent (if the ALE runs out before the home is completed) and replacement of items not covered by your policy. Other homeowners may consider selling the property and starting anew somewhere else. But this option also has some financial repercussions. According to Sassower, in order to sell a flood-, storm- or fire-damaged property, it has to be insurable — meaning that the potential buyer can still obtain homeowners insurance on the property (this is a requirement if the home is being purchased with a mortgage). If the property is too damaged and has to be razed, the other option is to sell the land, which may not be as attractive to most buyers. You’ll also take a big hit on the price. Depending on the amount of damage, Sassower says you may have to sell the home at a 20% to 80% discount of the original value. If the property takes a while to sell, you’ll still be responsible for paying the mortgage and other costs associated with the home. These are just some of the difficult decisions homeowners who live in high-climate risk areas have to face.  Climate risks  are also quickly becoming a prominent factor in homebuying decisions as the risk of damages from storms, fires and floods increases over time. “One can reasonably assume that these kinds of disasters will continue to happen [and] continue to be more catastrophic in the future,” Horvath says. “It’s very important to understand how you’re covered and where you may need to beef up your savings.” 7 Best Homeowners Insurance Companies Why California’s Wildfires Could Make Your Home Insurance Pricier — Even if You Don’t Live There Here Are the 10 Most Expensive States for Home Insurance Sign up for Daily Money to get the latest personal finance news straight to your inbox \n                      By clicking \"Continue\" I agree to receive newsletters and promotions from Money and its partners.

This devastating event is a reminder of how the climate crisis will increase the prevalence and severity of natural disasters. It has been  scientifically  proven our planet is warming because of human activities like deforestation, excessive burning of fossil fuels, industrial processes, and unsustainable agricultural operations. All of this is going on right in front of us, and yet people — like our president — still deny the fact that climate change is real. The  27  natural disasters in the U.S. last year cost the government $182.7 billion in damages. But, financial matters aside, we lost 568 Americans to extreme weather in 2024. The Los Angeles wildfires alone claimed the lives of 29 California residents. There have not been many details shared about the victims, but we know at least  two  people stayed behind to protect their familial homes, and one man stayed with his son, who was unable to evacuate due to his cerebral palsy. Unfortunately, for those whose insurance policies were canceled, the wildfires were not the only natural disaster to hit California last month. The first  winter rain  in Southern California led to landslides, flooding, and mudslides. Natural disasters almost always make headline news, but their connection to the global issue of the climate crisis is overlooked. This could be because climate change has become a political issue, and the increased polarization between political parties makes it a hot-button issue. I asked Shaun Vecera, a University of Iowa professor in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, about why the issue of climate change has become politicized and the psychological reasoning behind why people choose not to believe the science behind global warming. “There’s some really interesting history here because climate change hasn’t always been political,” Vecera said. “President George H. W. Bush was the first president to raise concerns about climate change. On the 1988 campaign trail, he famously said, ‘Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect are forgetting about the White House effect.’ As is often the case, though, lobbying and other efforts ended up politicizing the issue.” Vecera said because climate change has become a political issue, people base their opinion of global warming on their political party or their social group, as they try to adhere to their social norms. This motivates the rejection of climate science by those in social groups whose norms are to not believe in the climate crisis. I also asked Vecera about the presence of natural disasters and if they have any effect on people’s perceptions of climate change. Vecera said these natural disasters and their increasing prevalence can move climate change beliefs, especially among those affected by the disaster. He used Superstorm Sandy as an example, saying that those who were affected by the disaster showed the largest change in beliefs about climate change. We shouldn’t have to wait around for natural disasters to convince those choosing to deny the existence of global warming for something to be done about it. Unfortunately, President Trump is one of the ignorant few who are aware of the existence of climate change but choose not to accept it. On the day of Trump’s inauguration, he signed an executive order removing the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, which aimed to limit global warming. Without global collaboration on the issue of climate change, nothing will get done. Biden made significant  progress  during his presidency, signing executive orders to better America’s sustainability and lower the production of greenhouse gases. All of his hard work could be undone due to the current president’s belief that climate science is a hoax. If Americans learn anything from the devastation of the Los Angeles wildfires, it’s that natural disasters will keep happening on a larger scale if we don’t get serious about global warming.

Congress is considering steps to make it easier for victims of natural disasters to get aid. Currently, people seeking aid from the federal government but also have pending insurance claims can receive notice from the Federal Emergency Management Agency denying aid before the insurer has finalized the claim. Bipartisan legislation proposed Monday would prevent FEMA, which funds  disaster aid,  from denying help until the insurance claim has been resolved. In short, the bill would help end confusion over when people who need help immediately can get it. “Disaster survivors shouldn’t be left in the dark or forced to navigate complex red tape during their most vulnerable moments. That’s why we’re making sure FEMA no longer sends premature and confusing denial notices, allowing families to better focus on their recovery,” said  Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Long Beach. Joining him in the push for clarity is  Rep. Chuck Edwards,  R-North Carolina. His western North Carolina district was battered last summer by Hurricane Helene. “Getting a premature denial for assistance because FEMA doesn’t want to wait for a letter of coverage from an insurance provider has only made things more complicated for disaster victims,” he said. The bill would require FEMA to wait until it has all the information it needs to judge an application.  The wildfires  that spread through the Los Angeles area last month killed at least 29 people and displaced thousands from their homes. Hurricane Helene  was responsible for at least 230 deaths through several southeastern states last fall.

Yet even when aftershocks rattled our home, my mother found ways to ensure we had what we needed and she reassured us that things would improve. Looking back, I realize how much she had shouldered — not just the responsibilities of work and home but the immense task of keeping us safe and steady.

Homes were damaged or destroyed, and overcrowded temporary shelters brought new challenges. It made me realize again how disasters profoundly impact women in particular. Nepal is one of the world’s most  disaster-prone countries , with more than  80  per cent of the population at risk.  Women in particular experience barriers to resilience and recovery from disasters due to limited resources, restricted mobility, and economic dependence. Women make up  80.1  per cent of the agricultural workforce. When floods destroy croplands, and disrupt markets and supply chains, they lose their income. Additionally, many women have limited land rights and are excluded from relief measures, hampering their economic recovery and pushing them deeper into poverty. And as climate change impacts rural livelihoods, men migrate to seek better employment and more stable income. Women are left to shoulder responsibility for their households and communities, often without adequate resources to manage disasters. During and after floods, the lack of adequate sanitation and safe shelters increases the risks of gender-based violence in temporary displacement camps. Privacy and security are often compromised and essential services like clean water, hygiene facilities, and menstrual products are scarce. Due to the lack of or access to health facilities, during floods pregnant women to deliver at home or on the roads while trying to reach medical care. This situation exacerbates the already high maternal mortality rates in Nepal. Nepal has made efforts to integrate women’s concerns into disaster management policies, but significant gaps remain. To address women’s needs and recognize them as active agents rather than as passive victims, we must give them: Empowering Nepalese women with resources, support and a seat at the decision-making table is critical to building a more resilient, equitable society capable of withstanding the escalating impacts of climate change.

Local leaders say the Federal Emergency Management Agency was crucial to Moore’s recovery, even as President Donald Trump threatens to terminate the agency. (Tom Pennington/Getty Images) State and local emergency managers are facing a serious question in the wake of President Donald Trump’s first few weeks in office: When disaster strikes, will they be able to count on the federal government? Trump has called the Federal Emergency Management Agency a “disaster” and suggested it might “go away.” He said states would best take care of hurricanes, tornadoes and wildfires on their own, with the federal government reimbursing some of the costs. He convened a council to review FEMA and recommend “improvements or structural changes.” But leaders in states that have been hit by disasters say they need more than the promise of an eventual federal check to manage catastrophic events. They say they’re not equipped to handle the roles FEMA currently plays — such as marshaling emergency resources from multiple federal agencies, providing flood insurance, conducting damage assessments and distributing billions of dollars in recovery funds. “FEMA has been an absolute lifesaver for people,” said Vermont state Sen. Anne Watson, a Democrat who has been involved in the state’s recovery from devastating 2023 floods. “I don’t see [states and municipalities] as being able to replicate what FEMA does. The possibility of it going away leaves millions and millions of Americans in a very vulnerable position.” Meanwhile, Trump said last month that he wanted to make federal wildfire recovery aid to Los Angeles conditional on California enacting new laws requiring voter identification, adding further uncertainty about whether states can expect help from the feds. Trump and his allies also  targeted the agency  in the wake of Hurricane Helene, spreading lies that FEMA, under President Joe Biden, was diverting disaster money to immigrants without legal status; failing to provide helicopters; limiting aid to $750 per person; and cutting off support for Republican areas. State officials say that while there’s room for a conversation about state and federal roles in disaster response, eliminating FEMA altogether would be shortsighted. Facing natural disasters, more lawmakers look to make oil companies pay for the damage “I don’t think it makes sense to get rid of FEMA,” Lynn Budd, director of the Wyoming Office of Homeland Security, said in an interview with Stateline. “There are economies of scale [that a nationwide agency provides]. States don’t have that capability built to handle a disaster every single year.” Budd said she doesn’t believe Trump intends to terminate FEMA, calling such a move “not realistic.” She also serves as president of the National Emergency Management Association, a nonprofit comprising state and territorial emergency officials. Budd called on Trump to include state emergency managers on the council that will consider FEMA’s future. Emergency management experts say that Trump cannot unilaterally dissolve FEMA, which would require congressional action. However, Trump already has  taken actions  that appear to exceed his executive authority, including an attempt to freeze trillions of dollars in federal funding that had already been approved by Congress. FEMA does have some support from Trump’s Republican allies, especially given that red states have needed  more aid  in recent years. Since 2015, residents in Florida, Louisiana and Texas have received the highest amounts of individual assistance payments from FEMA, exceeding $2 billion in each state. But experts see much to fear in cost-cutting efforts by Trump and his billionaire ally Elon Musk, which so far have focused on slashing the federal workforce and forcing out officials with decades of experience. Such actions could cripple FEMA, even if it’s not officially “abolished.” “Senior people who don’t want to put up with this nonsense are going to walk away,” said Craig Fugate, who served as FEMA’s administrator under President Barack Obama. “It’s one thing to talk tough, it’s another to govern and provide services.” Over the past decade, FEMA has responded to nearly 1,400 disasters, including wildfires, severe storms, hurricanes, floods and tornadoes. The agency coordinates the federal response during emergency situations, such as calling the Pentagon to get rescue helicopters in the air or trucking in generators in the aftermath of a storm. But the agency’s larger purpose is focused on recovery, assessing the damage to communities and distributing funding to help them rebuild. Over the last four years, FEMA has provided more than $12 billion to individuals and $133 billion to state and local governments, tribal nations, territories and some nonprofits to help in recovery efforts. FEMA also provides much of the nation’s flood insurance coverage, as the private market has largely pulled back from flood policies. FEMA has been an absolute lifesaver for people. … The possibility of it going away leaves millions and millions of Americans in a very vulnerable position. – Vermont Democratic state Sen. Anne Watson Some governors, including Democrat Andy Beshear of Kentucky, have said Trump’s threats to dismantle FEMA are dangerous. “[I]t would be disastrous in and of itself for the FEMA organization to be dissolved,” he said, according to the  Kentucky Lantern . Beshear noted that replicating FEMA’s administrative functions in each state would be far more costly than a single national agency. FEMA, which was established in the 1950s, has taken on a larger role as Congress has added to its recovery mission, populations have grown in disaster-prone areas, and climate change has increased the frequency and severity of disasters. The agency has faced criticism at times — most famously after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 — for an overly bureaucratic system that has gotten bogged down in red tape. Some conservative groups have long argued that states should shoulder more of the burden of responding to disasters. Project 2025 , a hard-right blueprint that Trump distanced himself from during the campaign but which appears to have guided many of his actions since he took office, aims to limit states’ eligibility for disaster assistance or set a deductible that states must meet before the feds step in. Such cutbacks would incentivize states to “take a more proactive role in their own preparedness and response capabilities,” it said. The document also calls for states to take on much more financial responsibility for recovery efforts. States beg insurers not to drop climate-threatened homes Emergency managers say that there are opportunities to make FEMA more efficient. Fugate, the former FEMA chief, said the underlying problem is that the agency was not designed to replace insurance coverage, but is increasingly taking on that role as private insurers abandon disaster-prone areas. And increasing the pace of payouts also increases the risk of misspent funds, he said. “Nobody is saying we shouldn’t look at these programs and figure out how we move this money through faster,” he said. “But you’ve got that dual tension of, ‘I want to be fast but I’m a steward of the taxpayer’s dollars.’” Amid that discussion, experts say that rushing to dismantle the federal agency would be catastrophic. “The consequences [of dissolving FEMA] would be life-threatening,” said Juliette Kayyem, faculty chair of the Homeland Security Project at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government and a former Obama administration official. “The states are not built for that right now.” Local leaders who have experienced disasters say FEMA is essential. After an EF5 tornado swept through Moore, Oklahoma, in May 2013, the federal agency provided recovery support. “Sometimes I think people have a misconception of the purpose of FEMA. And it’s not to provide lots of equipment or manpower — they can do a little bit of that, but that’s not their primary function,” said Moore Mayor Mark Hamm, whose office is nonpartisan. Get rid of FEMA? Trump-appointed group to look at shifting disaster response to states. Hamm was on the city council when the mile-wide tornado killed 24 people, including seven students at an elementary school. Moore said FEMA provided crucial financial resources, reimbursing the city’s exorbitant overtime costs for police and fire crews. Moore is a bedroom community of about 63,000 people situated between Oklahoma City and Norman. The city’s annual budget is  about $133 million . The National Weather Service calculated the 2013 storm’s damage across the region at  $2 billion . The city has been hit by  two F5 tornadoes  since 1999. “When you have a natural disaster like the couple of F5 tornadoes that have come to our city — that would bankrupt our city, our budget,” he said. “That is a huge burden that this city just could not afford.” Hamm said he would be open to Trump’s talk of realigning FEMA, particularly if it allowed more funds to stay directly with states like his. But he said federal disaster funding must remain intact in some way. “When you need a lifeline, it’s reassuring to know that one is there and you can grab onto that rope, and there’s somebody on the other end pulling you to safety,” he said. “And the federal government was a lifeline, not so much in the recovery, but in providing the finances. I can’t emphasize that enough.” Eaton County, Michigan, was hit hard in August 2023, as tornadoes, severe storms and flooding struck the mid-Michigan region. FEMA’s response helped the community navigate aid and recovery programs and apply for federal assistance. “That federal support piece is critical to us to be able to respond and recover from disasters,” said Ryan Wilkinson, the county’s emergency manager. “Yes, we need reform for emergency management nationwide — at all levels — but shifting complete responsibility to the states would do greater harm in the long term.” YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.

Imagine a world in which a hurricane devastates the Gulf Coast, and the U.S. has no federal agency prepared to quickly send supplies, financial aid and temporary housing assistance. Could the states manage this catastrophic event on their own? Normally, the  Federal Emergency Management Agency , known as FEMA, is prepared to marshal supplies within hours of a disaster and begin distributing financial aid to residents who need help. However, with President Donald Trump  questioning FEMA’s future  and suggesting states take over recovery instead, and  climate change  causing  more frequent and severe disasters , it’s worth asking how prepared states are to face these growing challenges without help. FEMA was  created in 1979  with the job of coordinating national responses to disasters, but the federal government has played important roles in disaster relief since the 1800s. During a disaster, FEMA’s assistance can begin only after a state requests an emergency declaration and the U.S. president approves it. The request has to show that the disaster is so severe that the state  can’t handle the response  on its own. FEMA’s role is to support state and local governments by coordinating federal agencies and  providing financial aid and recovery assistance  that states would otherwise struggle to supply on their own. FEMA doesn’t “take over,” as a  misinformation campaign  launched during Hurricane Helene claimed. Instead, it pools federal resources to allow states to recover faster from expensive disasters. During a disaster, FEMA: The agency also manages the  National Flood Insurance Program , offers disaster preparedness training and helps  states develop response plans  to improve their overall responses systems. When wildfires swept through Maui, Hawaii, in August 2023, FEMA provided emergency grants to cover immediate needs such as food, clothing and essential supplies for survivors. The agency arranged hotel rooms, rental assistance and financial aid for residents who lost homes or belongings. Its  Direct Housing Program  has spent $295 million to lease homes for more than 1,200 households. This comprehensive support helped thousands of people begin rebuilding their lives after losing almost everything. FEMA also helped fund construction of  a temporary school  to ensure that students whose schools burned could continue their classes. Hawaii, with its relatively small population and limited emergency funds, would have struggled to mount a comparable response on its own. Larger states often need help, too. When a 2021 winter storm overwhelmed Texas’ power grid and water infrastructure, FEMA  coordinated the delivery of essential supplies , including water, fuel, generators and blankets, following the disaster declaration on Feb. 19, 2021. Within days, it awarded more than  $2.8 million in grants  to help people with temporary housing and home repairs. Without FEMA or other federal support, states would have to manage the disaster response and recovery on their own. States prone to frequent disasters, such as Louisiana and Florida, would face  expensive recurring challenges  that would likely exacerbate recovery delays and reduce their overall resilience. Smaller, more rural and less wealthy states that lack the financial resources and logistical capabilities to respond effectively would be disproportionately affected. “States don’t have that capability built to handle a disaster every single year,” Lynn Budd, director of the Wyoming Office of Homeland Security,  told Stateline in an interview . Access to FEMA avoids the need for expensive disaster response infrastructure in each state. States might be able to arrange regional cooperation. But state-led responses and regional models have limitations. The  National Guard   could assist with supply distribution , but it  isn’t designed  to provide fast financial aid, housing or long-term recovery options, and the supplies and the recovery effort still come at a cost. Wealthier states might be better equipped to manage on their own, but poorer states would likely struggle. States with less funding and infrastructure would be left relying on nonprofits and community-based efforts. But these organizations are not capable of providing the scope of services FEMA can. Any federal funding would also be slow if Congress had to approve aid after each disaster, rather than having FEMA already prepared to respond. States would be at the  mercy of congressional infighting . In the absence of a federal response and coordinating role, recovery would be uneven, with wealthier areas recovering faster and poorer areas likely seeing more prolonged hardships. Coordinating disaster response is complex, the paperwork for federal assistance can be frustrating, and the  agency does draw criticism . However, it also fills an important role. As the frequency of natural disasters continues to rise due to climate change, ask yourself: How prepared is your state for a disaster, and could it get by without federal aid?

When asked if the industrial and institutional laundry industry is prepared to face these disasters, 57.9% of respondents indicate it is “moderately prepared,” followed by “somewhat prepared” at 21.1%. Only 10.6% of operators who took the survey say the industry is “very well prepared.” Both “well prepared” and “not prepared” garnered 5.3% of responses. “It’s important to plan for ‘unplanned disasters,’” writes one respondent. “What will you do when it happens? How will you run your business with reduced staff? How will you run your business if your plant is destroyed? How will you communicate this?” Operators who took the survey shared several factors they believe services overlook in disaster preparedness, including: When asked how prepared their industrial or institutional laundry is for natural disasters, “moderately prepared” was again the top vote getter at 63.2%. Over 21% of respondents indicate their operation is “well prepared,” followed by “somewhat unprepared” at 10.5% and “not prepared” at 5.3%. No respondent indicated their operation is “very well prepared.” When asked to select all that apply from a list of disaster planning survey takers’ laundries have, appropriate insurance coverage topped the list at 94.4%. This was followed by a communication plan (88.9%), continuing service (backup) plan (77.8%) and a disaster drill schedule (55.6%). Half of respondents indicate their operation has a full disaster plan on file while 44.4% say they have a financial backup plan. Nearly 6% indicate they have a regional capacity plan with multiple plants. So, how many laundry operators who responded have endured a natural disaster in the past 10 years? More than 42% say their plant has, while nearly 58% haven’t. The disasters laundries have faced include: With the number of natural disasters seemingly on the rise,  American Laundry News  asked respondents how they gauged the level of risk from these events to the industry. Both “increasing” and “slightly increasing” received 42.1% of votes followed by “not changing” at 15.8%. No one thinks the industry’s risk from natural disasters is decreasing. “You cannot prepare for every type of disaster,” writes a respondent. “However, you can prepare for the most likely event.”  While the  Your Views  survey presents a snapshot of readers’ viewpoints at a particular moment, it should not be considered scientific. Due to rounding, percentages may not add up to 100%. Subscribers to  American Laundry News  e-mails are invited to take the industry survey anonymously online each quarter. All managers and administrators of institutional/OPL, cooperative, commercial and industrial laundries are encouraged to participate, as a greater number of responses will help to better define operator opinions and identify industry trends.

Please try again Here are the morning’s top stories on Monday, February 10, 2025… Extreme Weather Survivors  is a nationwide non-profit that includes a community of people directly harmed by disasters like wildfires, floods, extreme heat, deadly air pollution, drought, and hurricanes. It’s a space for survivors to support and learn from one another, and to fight to keep these disasters from happening to more families and communities. Jodi and Jeff Moreno are some of the newest members. Along with their three daughters, they lost their Altadena home of 19 years in the LA fires last month. Through the group, they were able to contact Erica Solove online. Solove survived one of Colorado’s most destructive fires on record, the Marshall Fire. Eventually Solove and her family rebuilt, and moved back to their neighborhood. The Morenos have questions that only a veteran fire survivor like Solove can answer. Like rebuilding and safety issues. But they’re not the only victims involved with Extreme Weather Survivors. “We can emotionally connect with all of our friends who are surviving this,” said Jeff Moreno. “And be there for each other. But none of us know what the next step is. You get to talk with people who went down the road.” As communities up and down California ban homeless encampments, one Bay Area city is trying to go a step further. The East Bay city of Fremont is set to vote Tuesday on a  new ordinance  that would make it illegal to camp on any street or sidewalk, in any park or on any other public property. But, in an apparent California first, it also would make anyone “causing, permitting, aiding, abetting or concealing” an illegal encampment guilty of a misdemeanor – and possibly subject to a $1,000 fine and six months in jail. That unusual prohibition — the latest in a series of crackdowns by communities following a Supreme Court decision last summer — has alarmed activists who worry it could be used against aid workers who provide services to people living in encampments. While Fremont Mayor Raj Salwan told CalMatters that police won’t target outreach workers handing out food and clothing, the ordinance doesn’t specify what qualifies as “aiding, abetting or concealing.” To learn more about how we use your information, please read our  privacy policy.

So if lumber is more expensive, then the cost of insurance is more expensive because you have to buy lumber to repair a house.” While insurance companies press for higher premiums from policyholders to cover liability, state insurance commissioners are fiercely negotiating with the companies to keep rates as low as possible to ensure that people can continue to purchase homes; lenders typically require homebuyers who are taking out mortgages to have homeowners insurance. Those negotiations can be challenging.  North Carolina Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey celebrated the deal he struck recently with the insurance industry over rate increases for state homeowners. document.querySelector('a#bth26kfhcj4000000').addEventListener('click', function () {\n    var xmlhttp = window.XMLHttpRequest ? new XMLHttpRequest() : new ActiveXObject('Microsoft.XMLHTTP');\n    xmlhttp.open('GET', 'https://ad.broadstreetads.com/click/1007217/c676546/z70688?', true);\n    xmlhttp.send();\n}) document.querySelector('a#bloe0ba5pkg000000').addEventListener('click', function () {\n    var xmlhttp = window.XMLHttpRequest ? new XMLHttpRequest() : new ActiveXObject('Microsoft.XMLHTTP');\n    xmlhttp.open('GET', 'https://ad.broadstreetads.com/click/313844/c248835/z70688?', true);\n    xmlhttp.send();\n}) document.querySelector('a#b5yyvzwrkm8000000').addEventListener('click', function () {\n    var xmlhttp = window.XMLHttpRequest ? new XMLHttpRequest() : new ActiveXObject('Microsoft.XMLHTTP');\n    xmlhttp.open('GET', 'https://ad.broadstreetads.com/click/917289/c612968/z70688?', true);\n    xmlhttp.send();\n}) document.querySelector('a#biicoya4pts000000').addEventListener('click', function () {\n    var xmlhttp = window.XMLHttpRequest ? new XMLHttpRequest() : new ActiveXObject('Microsoft.XMLHTTP');\n    xmlhttp.open('GET', 'https://ad.broadstreetads.com/click/831298/c637538/z70688?', true);\n    xmlhttp.send();\n}) document.querySelector('a#bkzws0s3h1c000000').addEventListener('click', function () {\n    var xmlhttp = window.XMLHttpRequest ? new XMLHttpRequest() : new ActiveXObject('Microsoft.XMLHTTP');\n    xmlhttp.open('GET', 'https://ad.broadstreetads.com/click/916535/c612914/z70688?', true);\n    xmlhttp.send();\n}) document.querySelector('a#bo7zea7q4tc000000').addEventListener('click', function () {\n    var xmlhttp = window.XMLHttpRequest ? new XMLHttpRequest() : new ActiveXObject('Microsoft.XMLHTTP');\n    xmlhttp.open('GET', 'https://ad.broadstreetads.com/click/1006676/c676160/z70688?', true);\n    xmlhttp.send();\n}) document.querySelector('a#bh3vjqcse00000000').addEventListener('click', function () {\n    var xmlhttp = window.XMLHttpRequest ? new XMLHttpRequest() : new ActiveXObject('Microsoft.XMLHTTP');\n    xmlhttp.open('GET', 'https://ad.broadstreetads.com/click/207522/c198399/z70688?', true);\n    xmlhttp.send();\n}) document.querySelector('a#b8a3458xdds000000').addEventListener('click', function () {\n    var xmlhttp = window.XMLHttpRequest ? new XMLHttpRequest() : new ActiveXObject('Microsoft.XMLHTTP');\n    xmlhttp.open('GET', 'https://ad.broadstreetads.com/click/1007215/c676543/z70688?', true);\n    xmlhttp.send();\n}) “The insurance companies wanted to raise our homeowners’ rates up to 99.4 percent in some areas and an average 42.2 percent statewide in a single year,”  Causey said in a statement  made in mid-January. “I fought for consumers and knocked them back to 7 percent increases over two years with a maximum of 35 percent in any territory. We consider this settlement a big win for both homeowners and North Carolina.” Causey claimed that North Carolinians will save more than $750 million in premiums during the next two years. The next rate hike discussions are expected in 2027. “These rates are sufficient to make sure that insurance companies, who have paid out large sums due to natural disasters and face increasing reinsurance costs due to national catastrophes, have adequate funds on hand to pay claims,” Causey said. Whether Causey’s statement holds true remains to be seen — in North Carolina and around the country — as the combined estimated costs for  destruction caused by Helene  and the recent  fires that ravaged the Los Angeles  area are more than $300 billion. Those total costs could affect future premiums as a weakened insurance industry, already hemorrhaging from previous losses in markets like California and Florida, looks to pass on the costs to policyholders across the country.  In North Carolina, as of Dec. 20, the claims filed related to Hurricane Helene totaled nearly $2.5 billion, with more than $1 billion in claims paid. document.querySelector('a#bqvod0bg1ow000000').addEventListener('click', function () {\n    var xmlhttp = window.XMLHttpRequest ? new XMLHttpRequest() : new ActiveXObject('Microsoft.XMLHTTP');\n    xmlhttp.open('GET', 'https://ad.broadstreetads.com/click/1006676/c676160/z70688?', true);\n    xmlhttp.send();\n}) document.querySelector('a#bn4ufbiomqo000000').addEventListener('click', function () {\n    var xmlhttp = window.XMLHttpRequest ? new XMLHttpRequest() : new ActiveXObject('Microsoft.XMLHTTP');\n    xmlhttp.open('GET', 'https://ad.broadstreetads.com/click/313844/c248835/z70688?', true);\n    xmlhttp.send();\n}) document.querySelector('a#bwt2jhzelz4000000').addEventListener('click', function () {\n    var xmlhttp = window.XMLHttpRequest ? new XMLHttpRequest() : new ActiveXObject('Microsoft.XMLHTTP');\n    xmlhttp.open('GET', 'https://ad.broadstreetads.com/click/916535/c612914/z70688?', true);\n    xmlhttp.send();\n}) document.querySelector('a#b37ptcmxvv4000000').addEventListener('click', function () {\n    var xmlhttp = window.XMLHttpRequest ? new XMLHttpRequest() : new ActiveXObject('Microsoft.XMLHTTP');\n    xmlhttp.open('GET', 'https://ad.broadstreetads.com/click/207522/c198399/z70688?', true);\n    xmlhttp.send();\n}) document.querySelector('a#biy8k9goh3k000000').addEventListener('click', function () {\n    var xmlhttp = window.XMLHttpRequest ? new XMLHttpRequest() : new ActiveXObject('Microsoft.XMLHTTP');\n    xmlhttp.open('GET', 'https://ad.broadstreetads.com/click/917289/c612968/z70688?', true);\n    xmlhttp.send();\n}) document.querySelector('a#b01n3gg289c000000').addEventListener('click', function () {\n    var xmlhttp = window.XMLHttpRequest ? new XMLHttpRequest() : new ActiveXObject('Microsoft.XMLHTTP');\n    xmlhttp.open('GET', 'https://ad.broadstreetads.com/click/1007215/c676543/z70688?', true);\n    xmlhttp.send();\n}) document.querySelector('a#bq161xekl80000000').addEventListener('click', function () {\n    var xmlhttp = window.XMLHttpRequest ? new XMLHttpRequest() : new ActiveXObject('Microsoft.XMLHTTP');\n    xmlhttp.open('GET', 'https://ad.broadstreetads.com/click/1007217/c676546/z70688?', true);\n    xmlhttp.send();\n}) document.querySelector('a#bdvpf0fa62o000000').addEventListener('click', function () {\n    var xmlhttp = window.XMLHttpRequest ? new XMLHttpRequest() : new ActiveXObject('Microsoft.XMLHTTP');\n    xmlhttp.open('GET', 'https://ad.broadstreetads.com/click/831298/c637538/z70688?', true);\n    xmlhttp.send();\n}) As of Jan. 30, roughly 31,210 claims related to Los Angeles’ Eaton and Palisades fires have been filed, and more than $4.2 billion has been paid to policyholders, according to information provided by the  California Department of Insurance . One might think the tragedies caused by Helene and the Los Angeles fires will only affect premiums in those areas. However, the costs will likely spread to people far from the scenes of devastation. Insurance companies purchase their own insurance —  known as reinsurance  — to help manage risk exposure  against catastrophic event s, which would likely result in large payouts to settle policyholder claims. As with individual insurance policyholders, insurance companies pay reinsurance coverage premiums and are subject to rate increases. Then those costs get passed on to everyday policyholders when reinsurance rates go up.  For instance, the massive payouts from the Los Angeles fires could increase homeowner insurance rates nationwide for customers of some insurance agencies such as State Farm and Farmers Insurance Group, which are two of the top coverage providers in the California market. Rates could also go up for companies that get their reinsurance from the same companies as State Farm and Farmers, as the reinsurers look to cover their costs. document.querySelector('a#bxp2y7nxhog000000').addEventListener('click', function () {\n    var xmlhttp = window.XMLHttpRequest ? new XMLHttpRequest() : new ActiveXObject('Microsoft.XMLHTTP');\n    xmlhttp.open('GET', 'https://ad.broadstreetads.com/click/1007217/c676546/z70688?', true);\n    xmlhttp.send();\n}) document.querySelector('a#b5y56qbqf5s000000').addEventListener('click', function () {\n    var xmlhttp = window.XMLHttpRequest ? new XMLHttpRequest() : new ActiveXObject('Microsoft.XMLHTTP');\n    xmlhttp.open('GET', 'https://ad.broadstreetads.com/click/831298/c637538/z70688?', true);\n    xmlhttp.send();\n}) document.querySelector('a#b798vdmin8g000000').addEventListener('click', function () {\n    var xmlhttp = window.XMLHttpRequest ? new XMLHttpRequest() : new ActiveXObject('Microsoft.XMLHTTP');\n    xmlhttp.open('GET', 'https://ad.broadstreetads.com/click/207522/c198399/z70688?', true);\n    xmlhttp.send();\n}) document.querySelector('a#bv9eog9bcww000000').addEventListener('click', function () {\n    var xmlhttp = window.XMLHttpRequest ? new XMLHttpRequest() : new ActiveXObject('Microsoft.XMLHTTP');\n    xmlhttp.open('GET', 'https://ad.broadstreetads.com/click/1007215/c676543/z70688?', true);\n    xmlhttp.send();\n}) document.querySelector('a#borb930a1m8000000').addEventListener('click', function () {\n    var xmlhttp = window.XMLHttpRequest ? new XMLHttpRequest() : new ActiveXObject('Microsoft.XMLHTTP');\n    xmlhttp.open('GET', 'https://ad.broadstreetads.com/click/1006676/c676160/z70688?', true);\n    xmlhttp.send();\n}) document.querySelector('a#b4e2z1rcb8g000000').addEventListener('click', function () {\n    var xmlhttp = window.XMLHttpRequest ? new XMLHttpRequest() : new ActiveXObject('Microsoft.XMLHTTP');\n    xmlhttp.open('GET', 'https://ad.broadstreetads.com/click/313844/c248835/z70688?', true);\n    xmlhttp.send();\n}) document.querySelector('a#b3rg897cgtc000000').addEventListener('click', function () {\n    var xmlhttp = window.XMLHttpRequest ? new XMLHttpRequest() : new ActiveXObject('Microsoft.XMLHTTP');\n    xmlhttp.open('GET', 'https://ad.broadstreetads.com/click/917289/c612968/z70688?', true);\n    xmlhttp.send();\n}) document.querySelector('a#b063rc0xr7k000000').addEventListener('click', function () {\n    var xmlhttp = window.XMLHttpRequest ? new XMLHttpRequest() : new ActiveXObject('Microsoft.XMLHTTP');\n    xmlhttp.open('GET', 'https://ad.broadstreetads.com/click/916535/c612914/z70688?', true);\n    xmlhttp.send();\n}) Hurricanes, forest fires and extended periods of drought and extreme heat are driven by a changing climate fueled by a continued reliance on fossil fuels, which send heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, destabilizing weather patterns and threatening the natural environment, economy and human life,  experts warn . For example, a  report published in January in JAMA  highlights the adverse effects of extreme heat on older adults. “Extreme heat can cause life-threatening heat stroke, exacerbate chronic conditions including cardiac, respiratory, and kidney diseases, and increase the risk of geriatric syndromes including orthostatic hypotension and falls,” the authors wrote. But the recent disasters do more than shed light on risks to human health as the climate warms. The tragedies portend a  destabilized housing market  if current trends hold and the homeowners’ insurance market continues to retract, making it harder for people to purchase homes and afford premiums. “It’s not that complicated,” Mark Hertsgaard, executive director of Covering Climate Now, said  during a recent webinar . “Property that can’t be insured cannot obtain a mortgage,” Hertsgaard said. “It’s also all but impossible to sell that mortgage without cutting the price to pennies on the dollar, and since homes are the single largest asset for most households in the United States, slashing their resale value could crash housing markets.” Our twice-weekly email will help you understand how health policy affects you, your family, your wallet. \" * \" indicates required fields Δ document.getElementById( \"ak_js_1\" ).setAttribute( \"value\", ( new Date() ).getTime() ); In North Carolina, people who own homes in eastern coastal areas of Brunswick, Carteret, New Hanover, Onslow and Pender Counties will see, at minimum, a nearly 21 percent increase in premiums during the next two years, according to information provided by the  North Carolina Department of Insurance . The increase — 71 percent higher than the project stated average — is largely based on the history of storms that have struck the coast. In recent years, that list includes hurricanes Isias, Matthew, Florence and Dorian, and effects from Hurricane Joaquin, which did not make a direct hit on the mainland U.S. “It’s not about if [a hurricane] is going to happen, it’s going to be more about when it happens,”  a North Carolina Department of Insurance spokesperson said by phone. During the 44-year period from 1980 to 2024, the Tarheel State experienced more than 100 “confirmed weather/climate disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion each,” according to information provided by the  National Oceanic Atmospheric Association . During those four decades, the state averaged nearly three events per year, NOAA states. However, during the most recent five-year period (2020-25), the average increased to more than seven events annually. Hurricane Helene caused significant property damage to homeowners in Buncombe and Mitchell counties. Still, their rate increases are much lower than the state average, with an expected two-year rise of roughly 9 percent and 2 percent, respectively. The proposed agreement reached between Causey and the  North Carolina Rate Bureau  lasts for two years. So it’s possible that homeowner insurance rates in Buncombe, Mitchell and other western North Carolina counties affected by Helene will also rise to reflect losses incurred by the insurance market in 2027, when rates are renegotiated. “Relatively speaking, if we get through the spring and don’t have significant wildfire activity in the West, if we get through hurricane season and don’t have a significant event that impacts North Carolina, then maybe we’ll be fine,” Stewart said. But he noted that “It’s just a very challenging insurance marketplace right now, and there are a lot of factors beyond our control.”  For North Carolina property owners who are unsuccessful in securing the type of insurance they want,  there are plans  provided by two intertwined nonprofit organizations. The first is the FAIR plan (short for  Fair Access to Insurance Requirements ), which is administered by the  North Carolina Joint Underwriting Association  and offered primarily to inland property owners. For coastal residents, there’s the  Coastal Property Insurance Pool , which is managed by the North Carolina Insurance Underwriting Association. The two nonprofit organizations provided $205 billion in coverage for more than half a million policies. They paid $1.7 billion in claims after Hurricane Florence in 2018, according to information provided by  Arch Capital Group , a global insurance provider. In an analysis, Arch Capital said that “North Carolina exemplifies robust public insurance planning, which is crucial in a state prone to wind storms.” “There are many reasons why someone might need coverage from us,” said Gina Hardy, chief executive officer of the North Carolina Joint Underwriting Association and the North Carolina Insurance Underwriting Association. “They may have a history of claims, live far from a fire department, own a high-risk dog, have an older home with outdated features like a roof or plumbing system that doesn’t meet private insurance requirements, or reside in an area with a higher risk of catastrophic loss—making it difficult to obtain homeowners insurance through the private market.”   Unlike some state FAIR plans on shaky ground, Hardy said she’s pleased with the services the nonprofit organizations provide North Carolinians who need them: “This is my 14th year as CEO, so I’ve done this for a long time in North Carolina. And we’ve been very stable over that period of time. “After Hurricane Florence, the North Carolina Joint Underwriting Association and the North Carolina Insurance Underwriting Association paid 90 percent of our 100,000 claims in 60 days,” she added. North Carolina is one of 34 states and the District of Columbia that offer FAIR plans. For owners of beach property that qualify, the North Carolina Insurance Underwriting Association “offer[s] grants to eligible policyholders in beach communities to help better protect their homes against hurricanes,” according to information provided by the organization. Those that qualify can apply for up to a “$10,000 grant toward the installation” of a hurricane-fortified roof. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis  has co-sponsored federal legislation  to make such grants aimed at making homes more disaster-proof excluded from being taxed as income. Causey, who said North Carolina has “the lowest average homeowner rates [among] southeastern states,” suggested steps people could take to ensure that they have good coverage, including shopping around for the best rates and getting quotes from local agencies when possible. He also recommended that people carry the highest deductible they can afford and refrain from filing a series of small claims that could result in higher premiums down the road — or lead to being dropped by an insurer. He also suggested a specific category of insurance people should purchase if they can afford it. “People need to have replacement value coverage because if you don’t have replacement value coverage, you’re going to cry when you get the claim check,” Causey said. “Insurance companies use something called Actual Cash Value […] and that means depreciated value.”  Causey said people who don’t have replacement value insurance will get short-changed by depreciation when it’s time to replace items they may have had for years. “If you have replacement value coverage and that new furniture costs $1,200, you’ll get that. It is worth a few extra dollars in your premium to have replacement value coverage, the same with the automobile.” Republish This Story Republish our articles for free, online or in print, under a Creative Commons license.

But we can’t do it alone. Up to 40% of the  world’s land is degraded 1.7B people have been affected by weather disasters in the past decade WFP provides nearly 18 million people with sustainable solutions < Prev  Next >  Disaster Strikes Millions of people living in fragile, disaster-prone areas have limited resources to adapt and are highly vulnerable to extreme weather events – like floods, droughts or hurricanes – when they hit. Immediate Effects Lives and livelihoods are lost as homes, land, livestock, crops and essential food supplies are destroyed. Coping Measures Food prices skyrocket as supplies dwindle. Parents take their children out of school, people eat less and less, and families sell any remaining valuable assets – like tools and cattle – to afford a meal. Food and Nutrition Crisis The lack of food and nutrition, which has been building up since the disaster hit, now explodes into a full-blown crisis. Families become largely dependent on humanitarian aid. Long-Term Impacts People’s overall food consumption drops and their dietary diversity reduces to just a few foods. Malnourishment rises, especially among women. Rates of stunting and wasting in children increase. Another Disaster Strikes People are unable to fully recover from one disaster before another strikes. They are pushed deeper into hunger and are more vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather. WFP is one of the leading hunger-fighting agencies in the world. We understand the impacts of extreme weather events, and we help vulnerable communities prepare for, recover from and build resilience to them. We provide food to people in exchange for their work on community assets like bridges, dams, roads, schools and irrigation systems. These projects can withstand extreme weather and have extra benefits like promoting nutrition and gender equality. We help communities restore degraded land, diversify their crops and build community gardens. A project in South Sudan increased agricultural land by 27% in just two years. We helped 9 million people through rehabilitation projects like these in 2023. We use every available tool to help people withstand extreme weather: hydroponics, satellite imagery and landscape monitoring software, just to name a few. Through projects like these, our Innovation Accelerator team helped over 1 million people in 2023. In areas prone to extreme weather events, every single grain counts.

Local leaders say the Federal Emergency Management Agency was crucial to Moore’s recovery, even as President Donald Trump threatens to terminate the agency. (Photo by Tom Pennington/Getty Images) State and local emergency managers are facing a serious question in the wake of President Donald Trump’s first few weeks in office: When disaster strikes, will they be able to count on the federal government? Trump has called the Federal Emergency Management Agency a “disaster” and suggested it might “go away.” He said states would best take care of hurricanes, tornadoes and wildfires on their own, with the federal government reimbursing some of the costs. He convened a council to review FEMA and recommend “improvements or structural changes.” But leaders in states that have been hit by disasters say they need more than the promise of an eventual federal check to manage catastrophic events. They say they’re not equipped to handle the roles FEMA currently plays — such as marshaling emergency resources from multiple federal agencies, providing flood insurance, conducting damage assessments and distributing billions of dollars in recovery funds. “FEMA has been an absolute lifesaver for people,” said Vermont state Sen. Anne Watson, a Democrat who has been involved in the state’s recovery from devastating 2023 floods. “I don’t see [states and municipalities] as being able to replicate what FEMA does. The possibility of it going away leaves millions and millions of Americans in a very vulnerable position.” Meanwhile, Trump said last month that he wanted to make federal wildfire recovery aid to Los Angeles conditional on California enacting new laws requiring voter identification, adding further uncertainty about whether states can expect help from the feds. Trump and his allies also  targeted the agency  in the wake of Hurricane Helene, spreading lies that FEMA, under President Joe Biden, was diverting disaster money to immigrants without legal status; failing to provide helicopters; limiting aid to $750 per person; and cutting off support for Republican areas. State officials say that while there’s room for a conversation about state and federal roles in disaster response, eliminating FEMA altogether would be shortsighted. Facing natural disasters, more lawmakers look to make oil companies pay for the damage “I don’t think it makes sense to get rid of FEMA,” Lynn Budd, director of the Wyoming Office of Homeland Security, said in an interview with Stateline. “There are economies of scale [that a nationwide agency provides]. States don’t have that capability built to handle a disaster every single year.” Budd said she doesn’t believe Trump intends to terminate FEMA, calling such a move “not realistic.” She also serves as president of the National Emergency Management Association, a nonprofit comprising state and territorial emergency officials. Budd called on Trump to include state emergency managers on the council that will consider FEMA’s future. Emergency management experts say that Trump cannot unilaterally dissolve FEMA, which would require congressional action. However, Trump already has  taken actions  that appear to exceed his executive authority, including an attempt to freeze trillions of dollars in federal funding that had already been approved by Congress. FEMA does have some support from Trump’s Republican allies, especially given that red states have needed  more aid  in recent years. Since 2015, residents in Florida, Louisiana and Texas have received the highest amounts of individual assistance payments from FEMA, exceeding $2 billion in each state. But experts see much to fear in cost-cutting efforts by Trump and his billionaire ally Elon Musk, which so far have focused on slashing the federal workforce and forcing out officials with decades of experience. Such actions could cripple FEMA, even if it’s not officially “abolished.” “Senior people who don’t want to put up with this nonsense are going to walk away,” said Craig Fugate, who served as FEMA’s administrator under President Barack Obama. “It’s one thing to talk tough, it’s another to govern and provide services.” Over the past decade, FEMA has responded to nearly 1,400 disasters, including wildfires, severe storms, hurricanes, floods and tornadoes. The agency coordinates the federal response during emergency situations, such as calling the Pentagon to get rescue helicopters in the air or trucking in generators in the aftermath of a storm. But the agency’s larger purpose is focused on recovery, assessing the damage to communities and distributing funding to help them rebuild. Over the last four years, FEMA has provided more than $12 billion to individuals and $133 billion to state and local governments, tribal nations, territories and some nonprofits to help in recovery efforts. FEMA also provides much of the nation’s flood insurance coverage, as the private market has largely pulled back from flood policies. FEMA has been an absolute lifesaver for people. … The possibility of it going away leaves millions and millions of Americans in a very vulnerable position. – Vermont Democratic state Sen. Anne Watson Some governors, including Democrat Andy Beshear of Kentucky, have said Trump’s threats to dismantle FEMA are dangerous. “[I]t would be disastrous in and of itself for the FEMA organization to be dissolved,” he said, according to the  Kentucky Lantern . Beshear noted that replicating FEMA’s administrative functions in each state would be far more costly than a single national agency. FEMA, which was established in the 1950s, has taken on a larger role as Congress has added to its recovery mission, populations have grown in disaster-prone areas, and climate change has increased the frequency and severity of disasters. The agency has faced criticism at times — most famously after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 — for an overly bureaucratic system that has gotten bogged down in red tape. Some conservative groups have long argued that states should shoulder more of the burden of responding to disasters. Project 2025 , a hard-right blueprint that Trump distanced himself from during the campaign but which appears to have guided many of his actions since he took office, aims to limit states’ eligibility for disaster assistance or set a deductible that states must meet before the feds step in. Such cutbacks would incentivize states to “take a more proactive role in their own preparedness and response capabilities,” it said. The document also calls for states to take on much more financial responsibility for recovery efforts. Emergency managers say that there are opportunities to make FEMA more efficient. Fugate, the former FEMA chief, said the underlying problem is that the agency was not designed to replace insurance coverage, but is increasingly taking on that role as private insurers abandon disaster-prone areas. And increasing the pace of payouts also increases the risk of misspent funds, he said. “Nobody is saying we shouldn’t look at these programs and figure out how we move this money through faster,” he said. “But you’ve got that dual tension of, ‘I want to be fast but I’m a steward of the taxpayer’s dollars.’” Amid that discussion, experts say that rushing to dismantle the federal agency would be catastrophic. “The consequences [of dissolving FEMA] would be life-threatening,” said Juliette Kayyem, faculty chair of the Homeland Security Project at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government and a former Obama administration official. “The states are not built for that right now.” Local leaders who have experienced disasters say FEMA is essential. After an EF5 tornado swept through Moore, Oklahoma, in May 2013, the federal agency provided recovery support. “Sometimes I think people have a misconception of the purpose of FEMA. And it’s not to provide lots of equipment or manpower — they can do a little bit of that, but that’s not their primary function,” said Moore Mayor Mark Hamm, whose office is nonpartisan. Trump floats ‘getting rid’ of FEMA as he visits North Carolina to survey Helene damage Hamm was on the city council when the mile-wide tornado killed 24 people, including seven students at an elementary school. Moore said FEMA provided crucial financial resources, reimbursing the city’s exorbitant overtime costs for police and fire crews. Moore is a bedroom community of about 63,000 people situated between Oklahoma City and Norman. The city’s annual budget is  about $133 million . The National Weather Service calculated the 2013 storm’s damage across the region at  $2 billion . The city has been hit by  two F5 tornadoes  since 1999. “When you have a natural disaster like the couple of F5 tornadoes that have come to our city — that would bankrupt our city, our budget,” he said. “That is a huge burden that this city just could not afford.” Hamm said he would be open to Trump’s talk of realigning FEMA, particularly if it allowed more funds to stay directly with states like his. But he said federal disaster funding must remain intact in some way. “When you need a lifeline, it’s reassuring to know that one is there and you can grab onto that rope, and there’s somebody on the other end pulling you to safety,” he said. “And the federal government was a lifeline, not so much in the recovery, but in providing the finances. I can’t emphasize that enough.” Eaton County, Michigan, was hit hard in August 2023, as tornadoes, severe storms and flooding struck the mid-Michigan region. FEMA’s response helped the community navigate aid and recovery programs and apply for federal assistance. “That federal support piece is critical to us to be able to respond and recover from disasters,” said Ryan Wilkinson, the county’s emergency manager. “Yes, we need reform for emergency management nationwide — at all levels — but shifting complete responsibility to the states would do greater harm in the long term.” This story was  originally published  by Stateline.

Few know about a provision in a law called Secure 2.0 that allows affected residents to tap their retirement accounts to help them rebuild. But as people assess the damage and make plans to rebuild or relocate, Kim doesn’t necessarily advise that they use their retirement funds to do so. Those savings are the last place you should turn to in an emergency, she said. “I would discourage anyone from doing it unless they were in a dire situation,” Kim said. “Time is of the essence when saving for retirement, and it should be your absolute last emergency fund.” Under the 2022 federal retirement law known as Secure 2.0, people affected by federally declared disasters can take up to $22,000 from their 401(k), individual retirement accounts or other retirement plans without paying the 10% early withdrawal penalty that would normally be applied to distributions taken before age 59½.  The relief available would offset only a fraction of the property damage seen in Los Angeles County from the Palisades and Eaton wildfires, which destroyed at least 16,000 structures including homes, businesses and schools, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The fires, which are now 100% contained after raging for nearly a month, burned more than 37,600 acres, and at least 29 people died.  California Gov. Gavin Newsom met with President Donald Trump at the White House on Wednesday as part of his effort to secure aid to help families and businesses in his state rebuild after the wildfires. That meeting came almost two weeks after Trump toured devastated areas of Los Angeles. “Whether it’s the Palisades Fire or Hurricane Helene, people have been devastated in recent months,” said Kyle Kraus, a financial adviser and senior wealth planner at San Diego-based AlphaCore Wealth Advisory. “I’m not sure, though, how far $22,000 can take you. But the opportunity is there.” He added: “Uncle Sam is only taking away the 10% [early withdrawal] penalty. The government doesn’t want you to raid your retirement money. Retirement accounts hopefully will be the very last resource people turn to.” The disaster-relief rules allow people to repay the funds within three years. If the funds are not repaid in that time frame, the money is considered taxable income, according to the Internal Revenue Service. The funds available are minimal compared with the damage caused, which totals more than $250 billion, according to weather-forecasting service AccuWeather. “We’re talking multimillion-dollar homes — $22,000 doesn’t even cover an architect, $22,000 on a multimillion-dollar home is two of their toilets,” said Eric Bond, a financial adviser and president of Bond Wealth Management. “It’s a disaster. People are living in convention centers. They need more than $22,000.” Read:  What people who rebuilt their homes after wildfires wish they’d done differently Secure 2.0 also allows residents in disaster areas to take a loan from an eligible 401(k) account of up to $100,000 or 100% of their vested balance, whichever amount is lower. That’s more generous than the typical rules, which limit loans to 50% of an individual’s vested account balance or $50,000, whichever is less. The loan must be also allowed under their employer’s plan.  A third element of Secure 2.0 allows a person to repay funds taken through a first-time homebuyer distribution from an IRA or a hardship withdrawal from a 401(k) if that money was intended to be used to purchase or construct a home that could not be purchased or built because of the disaster. Those affected by a natural disaster have 180 days from the event to make the withdrawals under the law.  FEMA  has information about natural disasters and their declaration dates, and the  Internal Revenue Service has a fact sheet on disaster relief and Secure 2.0 .  John Gillet, a financial adviser and the founder of the Gillet Agency in Hollywood, Fla., said residents in disaster areas should use retirement funds only after other sources of money such as emergency savings have been exhausted. “Although it may sound great to tap into retirement, the time and relative accumulation of that money is hard to replace. If your money is growing at a certain pace and you take out money, it takes you off course for your retirement. It should be the last resort,” Gillet said.

(Mario Tama/Getty Images) After nearly a month, the Eaton and Palisades wildfires that ravaged California have been  contained . But for Southern California and state agencies, another challenge lies ahead: helping people find homes. The wildfires levied significant long-term damage, with thousands of homes destroyed,  billions in damages  and a worsening of the state’s housing and homelessness crises. Even before the fires, California already had a  shortage  of 1.2 million affordable homes, with Los Angeles County alone  facing a deficit  of 500,000 units. “This tragic loss will certainly make the housing crisis more acute in multiple ways,” said Ryan Finnigan, an associate research director at the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at the University of California, Berkeley. “L.A. continues to need vastly more affordable housing, and people displaced from lost affordable units might need the most support to become stably housed again.” Even those displaced from market-rate or  high-end housing  will face challenges in an already tight market, with thousands searching for housing at once — likely driving prices even higher for everyone. Natural disasters are worsening the U.S. housing crisis, upending the home insurance market, and reducing housing options — particularly for lower-income residents. And that trend will likely grow as disasters become more frequent and severe. Climate change, experts warn, is the world’s fastest-growing driver of homelessness, displacing millions of people annually. In 2022 alone, disasters forced 32.6 million people worldwide from their homes, according to a  2023 report  by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre. If trends continue, 1.2 billion people globally could be displaced due to disasters by 2050,  according to  the international think tank Institute for Economics & Peace. The consequences are already playing out. After the 2023 Maui wildfires, homelessness in Hawaii  rose by 87% . With Los Angeles’ fires destroying about six times as many homes, experts predict that California’s homeless population will surge dramatically in 2025. “Natural disasters cause a massive spike in homelessness,” said Jeremy Ney, a macroeconomics policy strategist who studies American inequality. “The primary goal of relief organizations like the Red Cross is to prevent people from becoming permanently unhoused — but for many, it can take a decade or more to recover.” GET THE MORNING HEADLINES. According to the  Migration Policy Institute , 3.2 million U.S. adults were displaced or evacuated because of natural disasters in 2022, with more than 500,000 still unable to return home by the end of the year. The recovery timeline can be grueling. In North Carolina, state officials managing Hurricane Helene’s recovery warned that key federal funding for home reconstruction could be delayed for months — possibly into next fall,  according to NC Newsline . In the event of a disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, known as FEMA, focuses on shorter-term relief, offering emergency shelters, disaster unemployment assistance and grants for rebuilding. State agencies, though, are tasked with the long-term projects, such as making infrastructure repairs and developing housing initiatives, said Samantha Batko, a senior fellow in the Housing and Communities Division at the Urban Institute. “Disaster relief programs like FEMA focus on short-term recovery, whereas homelessness response systems struggle with long-term systemic challenges,” said Batko. “People who live in unsheltered places during disasters, like on street corners or in cars, have higher exposure to ash [from fires] and debris, which leads to more health issues and emergency room visits.” At the time of the Eaton fire, Los Angeles’ Skid Row was home to roughly 2,200 unsheltered people, experiencing some of the worst air quality effects, according to Batko, who co-authored a  report  on the issue for the institute. Los Angeles’ homelessness crisis was already dire: Last year, Los Angeles County had just 27,000 shelter beds for 75,000 unhoused residents. The fires have now left thousands more without homes, further straining an already overwhelmed system. “The relevant governments — state and federal agencies, L.A. County and its 88 cities — must be on the same page to mount an organized and effective response,” said Finnigan, of the Terner Center for Housing Innovation. There may be another twist coming. When President Donald Trump visited western North Carolina last month,  he floated the idea  of eliminating FEMA and leaving disaster response to the states, with federal reimbursement of some costs. He has since signed an  executive order  calling for a full assessment of FEMA and recommendations for “improvements or structural changes.” State emergency managers  quickly responded  that they need FEMA’s involvement. Disaster recovery is not equal: Homeowners with insurance typically rebound the fastest, as  policies cover  much of the rebuilding costs. But as climate disasters intensify, the insurance market has begun to unravel. In 2023, insurers lost money on homeowners’ coverage in 18 states — more than a third of the country — according to a New York Times  analysis . It’s led to an insurance crisis — rising premiums, reduced coverage or insurers pulling out altogether — a trend that began in  California, Florida and Louisiana  but that has spread across the country. Even before this winter’s fires, these insurance issues would have been a defining legislative issue for California, predicted Alexandra Alvarado, director of education and marketing at the American Apartment Owners Association, an industry lobbying group. “There’s a great anxiety from … property owners on whether they will be insured or covered when another wildfire or a similar event costs them their home, and whether it’s worth it to rebuild and start over,” Alvarado told Stateline in December. “I think it’s going to be on the radar of lawmakers not just in our state, because we’re seeing this play out in other states as well.” During the fires, California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara  reminded  insurers of their legal duty to cover mudslide damage caused by recent wildfires, as colder, wetter weather raises risks, particularly for Los Angeles County wildfire survivors. Already, State Farm, the largest home insurer in California, has  asked the state  to approve “emergency” rate hikes because of the fires, seeking an average 22% increase for homeowners and 15% for renters. The long-term recovery process is filled with hurdles — especially for low-income and marginalized communities. Lower-income households are disproportionately vulnerable to climate disasters; they’re also disproportionately harmed. Residents may reside in older, high-risk homes that are more susceptible to destruction. In some places, lower-income neighborhoods were built in low-lying flood plains because land was cheaper or red-lining kept families of color from living elsewhere. Many households cannot afford homeowners or flood insurance, and strict eligibility criteria may prevent them from qualifying for disaster relief loans, said Katie Arrington, a disaster recovery expert for Boulder County, Colorado. \n Natural disasters cause a massive spike in homelessness. – Jeremy Ney, economist Renters ,  mobile home residents  and uninsured households often can’t afford homes comparable to the ones lost to disaster. Without financial safety nets, many displaced residents face an impossible choice: endure months or years of instability, or leave their community altogether. “People with insurance have an easier time recovering than people without it. Homeowners, in general, recover more easily than renters,” Arrington said. “There’s a spectrum, from homeowners with full insurance to renters without insurance, and each group faces very different recovery timelines.” One major barrier to recovery for renters is the post-disaster surge in housing costs. A Brookings Institution report published in October 2023 shows that effective rents typically  rise 4%  after a disaster and remain elevated for at least five years. In the past few weeks in Los Angeles, fire-affected neighborhoods such as Venice and Santa Monica saw rents surge by 60-100% within days, fueling calls for  stronger enforcement  of California’s anti-price gouging laws. California lawmakers in January allocated billions in funding to state and federal government relief efforts and put an immediate moratorium on evictions. The governor’s office also has issued an executive order prohibiting Los Angeles-area landlords from evicting tenants who  provide shelter  to survivors of the Los Angeles-area firestorms. For many municipalities, past experience is the only real preparation for disaster recovery. And sometimes, a bit of luck helps, too. In 2021, the Marshall Fire in Colorado  forced the evacuation  of 35,000 residents in Boulder County and destroyed nearly 1,000 buildings. County officials say their response benefited from both preparation and circumstance. “Some of our success was due to experience, but some of it was luck. We had a vacant county-owned building available to house the disaster assistance center, which allowed us to act quickly,” said Arrington, the disaster response manager for Boulder County. “If we had needed to rent or find a less-central location, the response would have been slower.” Across the U.S., states are grappling with similar challenges. In North Carolina, state-led efforts such as the  Back@Home program  helped rapidly rehouse approximately 100 displaced households after Hurricane Florence in 2018, and later helped nearly 800 households find more permanent homes. The program has since become a model for addressing disaster-fueled displacement. Similarly, after Tropical Storm Helene last fall, Asheville, North Carolina, allocated $1 million in rental assistance to prevent displacement. While Red Cross and state-run shelters were scheduled to close by Nov. 10, the city coordinated with the WNC Rescue Mission to keep one shelter open longer for the remaining displaced residents. By Dec. 31, 2024, all nine remaining shelter participants had secured exit plans — ensuring no one was left without a place to go, according to the city’s spokesperson, Kim Miller. Hawaii also has launched large-scale relief initiatives. In response to the 2023 Maui fire, HomeAid Hawaii, in partnership with the state, developed interim housing solutions for 1,500 displaced residents for up to five years. “Disaster-driven homelessness requires targeted programs that meet the needs of people at risk,” said Batko, of the Urban Institute. “States must integrate housing policy into emergency preparedness, or they’ll find themselves overwhelmed when the next disaster strikes.” In Colorado, Boulder County  has managed  to rebuild or begin construction on about two-thirds of the homes that were lost. Boulder County is aiming for an ambitious 90% recovery rate, meaning 9 of 10 displaced households will find a new homes in the area. But even that success comes with a twinge of mourning for what was lost. “We started this recovery with a goal to get close to 90%, so we’re proud,” Arrington said. “But we also recognize that some parts of the community have changed forever.” YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.

By  Ken Bensinger  and  Jeremy Singer-Vine Ken Bensinger reported this article from Altadena, Calif., and Jeremy Singer-Vine from New York. As the chief executive of the crowdfunding site GoFundMe, Tim Cadogan is no stranger to disasters. But until the Eaton fire forced him to evacuate his own home in Altadena, Calif., last month, a crisis had never landed on his actual doorstep. He was in his home office, wrapping up work on the evening of Jan. 7, when he heard the thump of helicopters. He drew back the curtain and was greeted by a terrifying line of orange fire marching down the hillsides above his house. Moments later, Mr. Cadogan and his family evacuated. Although their home was not burned, they cannot return there for months, if not longer. That left Mr. Cadogan scrambling to file insurance claims and find a new place for his family to live, all while managing one of the biggest surges in donations ever made through his company’s platform. “I had a mission, which is help people, help each other,” Mr. Cadogan, 54, said about his company. “I felt like it was really deep in my core. But like, now it’s like in the bones, you know?” Advertisement Since the fires broke out, people have donated more than $250 million to victims of the Los Angeles fires as well as to charities working on relief efforts through GoFundMe — $20 million more than the company helped collect for all natural disasters worldwide last year, according to the company. More than a million donors in 160 countries have contributed to that total. Those donations, impressive as they are, cannot begin to cover the formidable costs of rebuilding Altadena, the Pacific Palisades and other areas devastated by the fires. That task, conservatively estimated in the tens of billions of dollars, will instead fall largely on  insurers, private developers and the government . And crowdfunding efforts have been the subject of frequent criticism, in part because their free-market approach  tends to reward those with wealthier networks  of friends and family. Still, at a moment when President Trump has  threatened to completely shut the Federal Emergency Management Agency  and life-altering natural disasters appear ever more frequent, the need for an efficient pathway for financial support for people who need to find shelter, clothing, food and transportation after a crisis has never seemed more urgent. Crowdfunding platforms — of which GoFundMe is by far the largest — are aiming to fill some of that need. Among those who have turned to the site for help is Catherine Ramírez, a single mother of two, who lost the house she was renting to the Eaton fire. The campaign her friends set up for her has raised a little over $13,000 to date — a small fraction of the $150,000 she estimates she will need to replace the specialized therapy equipment she needs for her son, who has cerebral palsy. Still, she said, the money has been helpful. Advertisement “I’m going to need every penny,” she said. Damen Wright posted before-and-after photos of the three-bedroom stucco house he shared with his siblings and parents on the GoFundMe campaign he and his brother started five days after the blaze. “In this time of need, we’re asking for your generosity in helping us meet the needs that might not be fully covered by other sources of aid,” reads the text of the fund-raiser. So far, it has raised $12,105. That is far short of the family’s goal of $30,000 to help cover rent costs while Mr. Wright’s family decides whether to rebuild, but Mr. Wright said the money had cushioned the financial toll. “It’s definitely helped,” Mr. Wright, who works for the Transportation Security Administration, said while he and his brother Damen, in white Tyvek suits, poked at the ashes of the home they grew up in. “Every little bit counts,” Mr. Wright said. The prominent role of GoFundMe in the recovery efforts has led to some confusion, and even false claims. Advertisement During a news conference four days after the fires began, Kathryn Barger, the chair of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, said she had been forced to pay a $95 fee to the company to make a $500 donation to a friend whose home had been lost in the fire. “I was shocked,” she said, adding, of the company, that “they deserve to be able to pay for their overhead, but at the same time, we are in a crisis.” In fact, Ms. Barger had confused the option to leave a tip on donations with a mandatory fee. Those tips are GoFundMe’s primary source of revenue and what allows it to be profitable, company officials say. But the tips, which can be adjusted from 0 to as high as 28 percent, are voluntary. The company also charges a 2.9 percent fee on all donations, as well as 30 cents for every transaction, which it says covers credit card and bank transaction fees. It also draws revenue from Classy, a subscription-based software company that helps clients including the World Central Kitchen and Salvation Army raise money. GoFundMe officials rushed to contact Ms. Barger’s office and straighten out the confusion, although not before multiple outlets published  critical articles . As it happened, Mr. Cadogan had been volunteering on a search and rescue team looking for dead bodies in Altadena when the controversy broke out, and he was oblivious to the public relations disaster. But the next day, he ran into Ms. Barger at a community meeting. “She gave me a massive hug,” he said, noting that since then Ms. Barger  had been promoting the fund-raising site . It was hardly the first time the site faced pushback. Over the years, it has been attacked for hosting campaigns by anti-vaccine activists as well as a fund-raiser by the men behind We Build the Wall, a charity that raised $25 million to build a border wall with Mexico but was later accused by prosecutors of illegally diverting that money for personal use. One of the founders of that group, Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s former adviser, is  set to face trial  for fraud in New York next month. Although the Los Angeles wildfire fund-raisers have not generated that kind of political controversy, they have been closely scrutinized after numerous people reported discovering  copycat fund-raisers using images of their homes  and designed to profit off the rush of public largess. Advertisement “We have zero tolerance for misuse of our platform,” said Matthew Murray, director of regulatory affairs at GoFundMe. He leads a team of over 80 employees — roughly 10 percent of the company’s work force — dedicated to trust and safety, which has been using machine learning and human review to ferret out scams and to create a list of vetted wildfire-related campaigns that are highlighted on the GoFundMe home page. More difficult to reckon with have been  questions of fairness  when it comes to disaster crowdfunding. To address those concerns,  curated lists of fund-raisers  began circulating on social media just days after the fires. One, for displaced Black families, now includes almost 800 campaigns; another, for Latino families, numbers over 600. The goal, for those and other similar lists, was to draw more attention to those groups and potentially increase the amount of money they bring in, said Pete Corona, a film and TV producer in Los Angeles who helped organize the displaced Latino list. “I think there’s some racial disparity that’s built into the algorithm,” Mr. Corona said. “We were hoping to address that.” A company spokeswoman, Sarah Peck, disputed that GoFundMe’s algorithm contributes to any racial disparities in fund-raising, saying that it “aggregates all verified fund-raisers related to the fires and displays them in a completely randomized order that is continuously updated.” According to two researchers at the University of Washington, Mark Igra and Nora Kenworthy, the Los Angeles fires have underscored concerns about inequality. Advertisement The researchers, who have  studied inequities in crowdfunding  for years, found that the median fund-raiser on the displaced Latino families list has raised just over $15,000, while the median fund-raiser on the Black families list took in around $17,500. A third list, for Filipino families, raised slightly more on the median: $21,000. But all three groups fall well short of the overall cohort of vetted fund-raisers on GoFundMe, which have a median amount raised more than $25,000. Mr. Cadogan, who has run GoFundMe since 2020, said he was acutely aware of the questions about fairness. To help address them, the company has been boosting the displaced family lists on social media, at times with celebrities and social media influencers, and has provided back-end support with vetting; it has also made donations of $1,000 apiece to more than 5,000 campaigns, drawing from money its raised through its nonprofit arm. That same fund has been used to support local charities that provide direct support to families in need. One of those groups, the Change Reaction, received $1 million from GoFundMe. At an event late last month, the charity handed out 1,800 checks ranging from $1,500 to $5,000 to victims of the Eaton fire in a packed gymnasium in Pasadena. Mr. Cadogan lingered for more than an hour after speaking to the crowd, listening to tearful people who had lost their homes and wanted to express gratitude for the support. “We can’t change the socioeconomic structure of this country,” he said. “But we can make a dent.” Ken Bensinger  covers media and politics for The Times.

Sign up for  WeeklyMatters  for a Saturday morning digest of the latest news and commentary from the Golden State. This story is part of  California Voices,  a commentary forum aiming to broaden our understanding of the state and spotlight Californians directly impacted by policy or its absence. Learn more  here . Guest Commentary written by Mary Creasman is the CEO of California Environmental Voters. Mike Young is the executive director of California Environmental Voters. California can step up big when it wants to.  Three years ago,  California received an ‘A’  on the California Environmental Scorecard, an annual tool to assess the state’s environmental action, after making landmark investments in climate justice solutions and adopting  sweeping policy  wins  across environmental sectors . In 2023 and 2024, California earned a ‘B’ for climate action — a period marked by big steps forward and some steps back.  With 2025 being ushered in by the  most devastating natural disaster in U.S. history , and the Trump administration retreating from the Paris Climate Agreement,  rescinding over 70 pro-environmental actions  and  attacking  California’s own conservation progress, this is California’s big call to action.  As one of the world’s largest economies, home to over 10% of Americans and the state that contributes over 14% of the nation’s revenue, California has a unique and outsized responsibility to be a counterweight against federal attacks, step up internationally and trailblaze the next wave of big state action.  With  five years left until 2030 deadlines  to avert the worst impacts of climate change and four years of a hostile federal government ahead, we can’t afford to pause globally or nationally on  implementing solutions . What state leaders do at this moment will have both local and global implications on whether we make the changes necessary to protect the places and people we care about.  The main obstacle to government action at the scale this crisis demands are corporate polluters as one of the biggest financial spenders on elections and lobbying in California. The  California Environmental Scorecard  started tracking legislators that accept money from Big Oil at the turn of the decade.  Δ document.getElementById( \"ak_js_1\" ).setAttribute( \"value\", ( new Date() ).getTime() ); Here’s why this is important: In 2021, 65% percent of California legislators accepted direct money from oil companies, and in 2024 that number dropped to 51%. In 2024, the average score of Democrats who took oil money is 70%, and  the average score of Democrats  who didn’t take oil money is 95%. The connection is crystal clear.  Read More:   Lobbying activity this past summer cost a record-breaking $168 million. Here’s what we know. The inability of state leaders to resist the oil and gas lobby and transition to clean energy and resilience left Los Angeles — and so many other communities — more vulnerable to supercharged natural disasters. The emotional, health and economic impact will be felt for years, and generations, to come.  California cannot afford inaction. The cost is too great. Beyond the devastation Los Angeles and other communities are experiencing, the fossil-fueled climate crisis is creating an affordability crisis with  rising energy rates ,  insurance costs  and more.  As much as California leaders have done — to be clear, they have done  a lot  — there is so much more needed in the next few years. Taxpayers and ratepayers have been paying for the devastation and mitigation caused by oil and gas companies, and corporate polluters must finally pay their fair share. California needs a polluters’ fund to invest in using national infrastructure to help conserve landscapes and make communities more resilient, mitigating against catastrophic fires, scaling up clean energy, and electrifying our buildings and transportation. We need to pass robust  insurance  and utility reform. And agencies, like the California Air Resources Board and local Air Quality Management Districts, have the opportunity this year to phase out residential fossil fuel appliances driving pollution and health impacts, while also reforming utility regulations. Oil and gas pollution put the things we value at risk. We have a unique opportunity in a challenging time that we need to get right. This moment is California’s big call to action. The vision and focus state leaders show right now will determine our reality today and in the future. Read more from CalMatters Text Get breaking news on your phone.

As the economic impact of the blaze becomes clearer, preliminary estimates from AccuWeather place total damages and losses between $250 billion and $275 billion. If accurate, this would exceed the inflation-adjusted $201.3 billion cost of Hurricane Katrina, the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history. In 2024 alone, there were 27 weather and climate disasters across the U.S. resulting in approximately $182.7 billion in damages, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). These events included two winter storms, one wildfire, one drought, one flood, six tornados, five tropical storms or hurricanes and 11 other severe weather events.  Since 1980, there have been 403 weather and climate disasters with damages at or above $1 billion, totaling an inflation-adjusted $2.917 trillion. Here’s a look at the 10 natural disasters that caused the most monetary damage, based on data from NOAA. All dollar figures have been adjusted for inflation. When:  August 2005 Estimated cost:  $201.3 billion What first made landfall north of Miami as a Category 1 storm strengthened to a Category 3 once it hit the Gulf Coast states. Hurricane Katrina's fury caused a rise in seawater levels, wind damage and the failure of the New Orleans’ levee system, resulting in more than 1,800 deaths and displacing more than 1 million people. When:  August 2017 Estimated cost:  $160 billion The Category 4 hurricane caused historic flooding across Houston and surrounding areas. More than 30 inches of rain fell on 6.9 million people causing over 100 deaths, displacing more than 30,000 people and destroying more than 200,000 homes and businesses. \n                         \n                         Subscribe to the Game On! Newsletter Highlights of the latest games & tips to keep you on top! When:  September 2022 Estimated cost:  $160 billion Four counties in Florida reported over 20 inches of rainfall as Hurricane Ian, a Category 4, slowly crawled across the state. After downgrading to a tropical storm and moving into the Atlantic, Ian regained strength and made a second landfall in South Carolina as a Category 1 hurricane with sustained winds of 85 mph, causing significant coastal flooding. When:  September 2017 Estimated cost:  $115.2 billion Puerto Rico faced the greatest amount of damage from Hurricane Maria. The island experienced widespread collapse of its transportation, agriculture, communication and energy infrastructure. The exact death toll caused by the storm is unknown. NOAA estimated nearly 3,000 deaths, but Harvard researchers put the number anywhere between 800 and 8,500. When:  October 2012 Estimated cost:  $88.5 billion The late October storm brought wind, rain and heavy snow to the Northeast when it merged with a developing nor'easter. High winds and storm surge caused the most damage to New York and New Jersey's water and electrical services, resulting in an estimated 159 deaths. The New York Stock Exchange closed for two consecutive business days for the first time since 1888. \n                         \n                         Montway Auto Transport $100 off car shipping When:  August 2021 Estimated cost:  $84.6 billion Ida is just one of three hurricanes in recorded history to make landfall in Louisiana with sustained winds of 150 mph. The storm heavily damaged the state's energy infrastructure leaving millions without electricity for nearly a week. In Grand Isle, Louisiana, 100% of its homes suffered damage and almost 40% were nearly-to-completely destroyed.  AARP NEWSLETTERS Get  The Daily  for news that matters The latest in health, money, entertainment, jobs, and travel each weekday! Privacy Policy ARTICLE CONTINUES AFTER ADVERTISEMENT When:  September 2024 Estimated cost:  $78.7 billion Helene was the third hurricane to strike Florida’s Big Bend region in just over a year, bringing record-breaking 140 mph winds—the strongest ever recorded in the area. While the Category 4 storm’s most severe impact was over 30 inches of rainfall, it also produced 15-foot storm surges in Florida, caused billions of dollars in agricultural damage in Georgia, and flooded much of western North Carolina. Southwestern Virginia and Eastern Tennessee were also hit hard by heavy rains and flooding. When:  September 2017 Estimated cost:  $64 billion One-quarter of the homes in the Florida Keys were destroyed and two-thirds were severely damaged from the severe wind and storm surge of the Category 4 hurricane. This after Irma, then a Category 5, devastated the U.S. Virgin Islands. Nearly 100 people were killed as a result of the storm. When:  August 1992 Estimated cost:  $60.5 billion Andrew is one of just four known Category 5 hurricanes to hit the U.S. mainland. (The others were Michael in 2018, Camille in 1969 and the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935.) The storm's high winds damaged or destroyed over 125,000 homes and left at least 160,000 people homeless in Dade County, Fla., alone. Andrew later impacted Louisiana as a Category 3. When:  Summer 1988 Estimated cost:  $54.6 billion From June through August 1988 a drought across a large portion of the U.S. severely impacted farmers and other agricultural industries. NOAA put the official estimate of fatalities at 454, but deaths indirectly related to heat stress may have hit 5,000.rricane.

Two new EU laws will offer quick EU funding for recovery measures following natural disasters that have occurred after 1 January 2024. The Regional Emergency Support to Reconstruction (“RESTORE”) proposal allows EU countries to more easily channel European regional development funds (ERDF) and cohesion funds to disaster reconstruction. As a result, the EU’s ERDF could fund recovery projects up to 95% of their total cost. To provide quick liquidity to those in need, additional pre-financing of up to 25% of the full amount would also be made available. The proposal would allow for more flexible use of European Social Fund Plus funds to finance short-term work schemes, support access to healthcare and provide basic necessities. Flexibility would apply to disasters in 2024 or 2025. In 2025, the proposed changes are expected to mobilize €3 billion in funding by front-loading payments for the 2025–2027 period. Recovery in agriculture and forestry EU countries with unspent money from rural developments programmes will be able to fast-track the use of this money to compensate losses of farmers, forest holders and SMEs active in these sectors that have experienced destruction of at least 30% of their production potential. This money will be paid in lump sums and will be fully covered by EU funds. Payments to beneficiaries will be made by the end of 2025. Quotes Andrzej BUŁA (EPP, PL) , co-rapporteur for the RESTORE regulation said: “This law is very important for regional and local authorities in regions affected by natural disasters. It shows that the EU is capable of working quickly and flexibly, and that we provide real help for our fellow European citizens. That help can now become quickly available.” Younous OMARJEE (the Left, FR)  co-rapporteur for the RESTORE regulation stated: “After Parliament expressed full support for the victims of the unprecedented storm in Mayotte, we adopted the RESTORE law to ensure we can help the victims of this catastrophe and others like it to rebuild what they have lost. We need to adapt our disaster response and regional policy to the new realities of climate change. RESTORE will allow us to respond quickly and effectively to future disasters.\" Veronika VRECIONOVÁ (ECR, CZ) , rapporteur for the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) related regulation, said: “Several countries have been affected by natural disasters in 2024, and the concrete help the EU is providing is much needed by both countries and citizens. Today’s decision will help many member states release unspent funds more quickly for those who urgently need them.” The “RESTORE” proposal was adopted by 638 votes in favour, 10 against with 5 abstentions.

Gavin Newsom told NBC News’ “Meet the Press” Saturday that the Los Angeles-area wildfires will be one of the worst natural disasters in U.S. history and called for an independent investigation into the local water supply. “I think it will be in terms of just the costs associated with it, in terms of the scale and scope,” Newsom said when asked whether the disaster would be among the nation’s worst ever. His remarks came after firefighters said  some fire hydrants ran dry  in the first several hours as they were battling flames across greater Los Angeles on Wednesday. “Was it just overwhelm? That you had so much that was used, we drew it down? Was it pipes? Was it electricity? Was it a combination of pipes, electricities and pumps? Was that drawdown impossible because you lost seven-plus thousand structures right here anyway, and every single structure we lost had a pipe that was leaking, and we would’ve lost that water pressure anyway?” Newsom asked. “Did it contribute in any way to our inability to fight the fire? Or were 99 mile-an-hour winds determinative and there was really no firefight that could’ve been more meaningful?” he continued asking. On Wednesday, President-elect Donald Trump blamed Newsom and President Joe Biden for the lack of water in fire hydrants,  writing on Truth   Social , “NO WATER IN THE FIRE HYDRANTS, NO MONEY IN FEMA. THIS IS WHAT JOE BIDEN IS LEAVING ME. THANKS JOE!” The president-elect also criticized Newsom for not signing on to a plan that would have diverted water from Northern California to Southern California during Trump’s first term. Experts have said the debate has nothing to do with the current wildfires,  which were caused  by a long period without rain and heavy winds. Newsom “wanted to protect an essentially worthless fish called a smelt, by giving it less water (it didn’t work!), but didn’t care about the people of California,”  the president-elect wrote  in one Truth Social post. Trump is “somehow connecting the delta smelt to this fire, which is inexcusable because it’s inaccurate. Also, incomprehensible to anyone that understands water policy in the state,” Newsom said Saturday. He also  blasted Trump for spreading other disinformation  about the wildfires. The president-elect last week also attacked Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, a Democrat, writing on Truth Social that “Fire is spreading rapidly for 3 days — ZERO CONTAINMENT. Nobody has ever seen such failed numbers before! Gross incompetence by Gavin Newscum and Karen Bass.” On Saturday, Newsom said, “I have absolute faith in our community. I have faith in our leaders. I have the faith of our capacity to work together,” when asked whether he has faith in Bass, who was absent from Los Angeles when the wildfires broke out as she returned home from a trip to Ghana. Newsom also lauded Biden specifically, thanking him for issuing  a major disaster declaration  and allowing federal funds to flow to the state. “I’m blessed on behalf of 40 million Americans that happen to live in California that Joe Biden is president of the United States and did what he did immediately,” he said. “And to the extent that we can work with the same relationship and that same spirit with Donald Trump, I hope we can.” Newsom also spoke about his plans for rebuilding the city in the aftermath of the fires, speaking specifically about Los Angeles’ role in  hosting the 2028 Olympic Games. “President of the United States, Donald Trump, to his credit, was helpful in getting the Olympics to the United States of America, to get it down here in L.A. We thank him for that. This is an opportunity for him to shine, for this country to shine, for California and this community to shine,” Newsom said. Ahead of the Olympics, Newsom added, “we’re already organizing a ‘Marshall Plan.’ We already have a team looking at reimagining L.A. 2.0, and we are making sure everyone’s included, not just the folks on the coast, people here that were ravaged by this disaster.” “We’re already talking to city leaders. We’re already talking to civic leaders. We’re already talking to business leaders, with nonprofits. We’re talking to labor leaders. We’re starting to organize how we can put together a collection of individuals on philanthropy for recovery. How we can organize the region,” Newsom said.

Cornyn.  “This legislation would help homeowners update at-risk homes in a cost-efficient way and help more families in Texas and across the country prepare for future storms.”  “Too many American families have seen their homes damaged or destroyed by extreme weather and other disasters,”  said Sen. Fetterman.  “We can’t afford to keep rebuilding the same way and expecting different results. Just look at the devastation from Hurricane Debby—thousands of Pennsylvania families lost everything last summer and are still struggling to recover. This bill is a practical solution that will help make it easier for people to secure their homes before disaster strikes. I’m proud to team up with Senator Cornyn to get this done.” Background:  This legislation would improve resilience of homes by allowing more states and local communities to be eligible for the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Pre-Disaster Mitigation Program.  It would ensure state and local governments retain control over the building code adoption process while advancing housing resilience through a practical, targeted approach. A key component of this legislation is the Residential Retrofit and Resilience Pilot Program, which provides a cost-effective way to strengthen older and at-risk homes against natural disasters without imposing unnecessary mandates on new construction and limits funding to 10% of Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program’s annual budget.  The  Promoting Resilient Buildings Act  would: This legislation is endorsed by the National Association of Homebuilders.

They're also wreaking havoc for already struggling home insurers. Few places embody wealth and glamour quite like the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles. The exclusivity of such neighborhoods in the city is one of the reasons  why the wildfires which have struck the wider Los Angeles area could become one of the costliest natural disasters in US history. The wildfires have left at least 24 people dead, and have already destroyed tens of billions of dollars' worth of property. They've threatened iconic landmarks   and have reduced several well-known LA locations and buildings to ash . Estimates of the damages by insurers have risen as the disaster has worsened. New estimates from Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs put the potential losses for the insurance industry at $30 billion (€29.2 billion). JPMorgan and others last week put a figure of around $20 billion on the losses. It now appears that the wildfires will prove the most expensive wildfire disaster in US history in terms of insured losses (see graphic below), eclipsing the costs of other recent disasters in California and Hawaii. To date, the Camp Fire which struck Northern California's Butte County in November 2018  is the costliest in US history, by insured losses. The insurance firm Aon estimated its losses at just under $13 billion. Notably, the top four costliest US wildfires have all occurred in the past seven years. However, the final tallies of insurance losses from natural disasters can vary dramatically from initial estimates, as it's difficult to make accurate predictions when the disaster is ongoing. There is also the distinction between insured losses — the assessed monetary amount of actual damages and losses covered by insurance — and wider economic damage which includes uninsured losses. Wider economic loss can also include lost wages, lost income for businesses and supply chain disruption. The private US weather service AccuWeather, which also measures the costs of weather events, now estimates total losses at between $250 billion and $275 billion, almost double what it estimated last week. If those figures are borne out, it would make the LA wildfires the costliest natural disaster in US history. \"These fast-moving, wind-driven infernos have created one of the costliest wildfire disasters in modern US history,\" AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jonathan Porter said on  the company's website . \"Hurricane-force winds sent flames ripping through neighborhoods filled with multi-million-dollar homes. The devastation left behind is heartbreaking and the economic toll is staggering.\" Officials have said 12,000 buildings have already been destroyed, including many businesses. There is also significant damage to infrastructure, adding to the longer-term costs of reconstruction In terms of the costliest US natural disasters ever, the most expensive to date were all hurricane events. The most expensive by far was  Hurricane Katrina, the devastating 2005 tropical cyclone  which led to massive loss of life and economic damage, particularly in the southern city of New Orleans. The estimated insured losses alone for Hurricane Katrina were more than $100 billion, according to Aon. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (see graphic), the total costs of the disaster were just shy of $200 billion, ahead of Hurricane Harvey (2017), Hurricane Ian (2022), Hurricane Maria (2017) and Hurricane Sandy (2012). The wildfires are expected to put major pressure on California's already embattled home insurance sector. Firms in the area are bracing for tens of billions of dollars worth of losses, including companies such as Chubb and Travelers, which typically specialize in providing insurance for expensive, exclusive properties. Some companies, such as Allstate and State Farm, recently stopped selling new home insurance in California. They blamed regulatory caps on home insurance price rises in the state, which they say make it increasingly difficult to operate in a region that has been hit by many severe wildfires in recent years. \nThat has left many homeowners without private insurance and reliant on California's public insurance system, known as Fair Plan. Fair Plan is estimated to have exposure of around $6 billion in the exclusive Pacific Palisades area alone, one of the areas worst affected by the fires. High losses for Fair Plan could force private insurers to step in, as the public plan has provisions for private insurers to pay for the claims it can't meet. The growing prevalence of wildfires in California could force a rethink of the state's entire home insurance system, some analysts have suggested. Climate change has intensified wildfire season in the state,  with major cities and high density areas increasingly threatened .

You can email him at mwreden@actionnewsnow.com An American flag flies over the remains of destroyed homes as powerful winds fueling devastating wildfires in the Los Angeles area force people to evacuate, in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of west Los Angeles. WASHINGTON, D.C.  - In response to the growing insurance crisis in disaster-prone regions, Congressman Doug LaMalfa (R-Richvale) and Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) have introduced new legislation designed to help homeowners strengthen their properties against wildfires and other natural disasters. The Disaster Resiliency and Coverage Act of 2025 aims to address the financial challenges many homeowners face as insurance companies increase rates or exit certain markets due to the rising frequency and intensity of natural disasters, according to LaMalfa and Thompson. \"Homeowners should be able to lower their insurance costs by reducing the risks to their property, but right now, many are stuck with skyrocketing rates or no coverage at all,\" said Rep. LaMalfa. \"This bill gives them a real chance to make improvements that not only strengthen their homes but also help bring insurers back to the market.\" Rep. Thompson, who represents areas severely impacted by wildfires, added, \"Property insurance has quickly become one of the single biggest issues I hear about in my district. People can't get covered: either the available options are completely unaffordable, or there are no options available at all. It's an untenable situation. By incentivizing homeowners to mitigate disaster risks on their property, we aim to bring insurers back into the market and bring rates back into more affordable territory.\" Key Features of the Legislation: Grant Program:  The bill establishes a grant program, managed through state governments, that offers up to $10,000 for homeowners in designated disaster-prone regions to fund approved disaster resiliency projects on their properties. Tax Relief:  Payments from state-run disaster resiliency programs and federal emergency agricultural programs would not be considered income for federal tax purposes. 30% Tax Credit:  A 30% tax credit will be provided to individuals or businesses for qualified disaster risk mitigation activities. This credit is designed to complement the grant program and offer additional financial support, particularly for larger property owners whose mitigation efforts may exceed the $10,000 grant.

Promotional Rates  were found for your code.\n    \n     Sorry , an error occurred. do not remove The recent wildfires in Southern California and natural disasters elsewhere in the country have left thousands of people grappling with enormous loss — and the complex insurance claims process that follows.   Insurance companies owe a duty of good faith and fair dealing with policyholders. Unfortunately, some carriers use unfair, manipulative and deceptive practices to delay, deny or minimize payouts of valid claims. This is known as insurance bad faith — and it is crucial to be on the lookout for these tactics.  While I do not recommend immediately hiring an attorney, under some circumstances — such as when bad-faith is suspected — there is no choice.   It never hurts to schedule a consultation at the very beginning, as a lawyer can help clarify your insurance coverages and be ready to help if it turns out that your carrier isn’t playing by the rules. But as I stated in an earlier column, unless your carrier has flat out denied the loss or you suspect bad faith, allow the claims process to proceed and do not rush to retain an attorney, as the expense might not yet be justifiable. I spoke with Los Angeles attorney Shant Karnikian, managing partner and trial attorney with one of our country’s leading bad-faith law firms, Kabateck LLP. He addressed the following important points for how to proceed with an insurance claim and avoid common pitfalls. Seeking advice early in the process from an attorney experienced with property losses — before filing your claim — is advisable, but ethical lawyers will not rush to sign you up unless it becomes clear that you are being dealt with improperly. Karnikian points out that bad faith comes in many forms, including: If you believe your insurer is using bad-faith tactics to resist paying a valid claim, you can file a complaint with your state’s Department of Insurance, which will conduct an investigation and has the authority to impose penalties and fines on companies for violations. A successful claim — negotiated by an attorney — can help you gain compensation for: - Contract damages. The amount of wrongfully denied benefits, plus interest in addition to significant economic losses, as well as mental and emotional distress caused by your insurance company's failure to fulfill its contractual obligations, including attorney fees. Punitive damages can be awarded to punish the at-fault party. “Lawyers who care will try every way possible to keep their clients out of court,” Karnikian says. “We are here to listen and help.” Dennis Beaver Practices law in Bakersfield and welcomes comments and questions from readers, which may be faxed to  (661) 323-7993, or e-mailed to  Lagombeaver1@Gmail.com.  Also, visit  dennisbeaver.com .

We investigate how fear shapes climate attitudes across political orientations. Utilizing data from a 2023 online survey, results support hypotheses that conservatives demonstrate lower climate concern and that fear of natural and environmental disasters increases climate concern. Interaction results show that fear of anthropogenic environmental disasters elicits greater climate concern amongst conservatives. At high levels of ecological fear, the political divisions diminish as all orientations converge on higher levels of acknowledging climate risks and causes. Practically, this relationship highlights messaging opportunities by focusing on relevant environmental threats that aid in influencing conservatives to build collective support across political divides. Theoretically, these findings challenge expectations of dominant paradigms related to threat perception and political orientation, contributing to the ongoing development of new models that more thoroughly represent the relationship between these multifaceted constructs. Climate change poses one of the most significant threats to human civilization, with far-reaching consequences for ecosystems, economies, and public health worldwide 1 . However, due to its global scale and gradual, ambient influence on the environment, climate change and its ramifications are difficult to subjectively assess 2 , 3 . This presents substantial challenges for scientists and communicators tasked with disseminating climate information to the public and motivating climate change mitigation, as concern for climate change is moderated by a myriad of cognitive, socio-demographic, and political factors 4 . Of these factors, political orientation has consistently emerged as the defining predictor of climate concern (which we define as the worry and importance afforded to anthropogenic climate change) within the United States 5 , with Republicans and conservatives expressing considerably more skepticism toward the reality of climate change and its associated risks 6 , 7 , 8 . This trend is also observed internationally, as similar patterns have increasingly emerged following the global escalation of political polarization 9 . Such ideological resistance to climate initiatives creates significant barriers to mitigation efforts 10 , generating an urgent need for interventions to improve support for climate policy across the political spectrum. In examining the relationship between threat and political orientation, the dominant theoretical paradigms propose that exposure to any type of threat is associated with either an ideological shift towards conservatism 11 , 12  or a blanket intensification of existing political preferences 13 , 14 . Simply, as climate-based threats are made salient, these models predict that political conservatives will maintain or strengthen their preexisting beliefs about climate change. These hypotheses appear to challenge the efficacy of any behavioral intervention designed to mobilize more climate-friendly attitudes or behaviors among conservatives, as acknowledging climate change and its consequences as legitimate threats is a necessary prerequisite to broad climate mitigation 15 , 16 . Recent literature, however, suggest that these seminal theories persistently neglect to consider the political and affective context of threats 15 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20  leading to an overrepresentation of threats that increase the appeal of conservatism [e.g., terrorism 21 , 22 ]. Accordingly, we are aware of few studies that explicitly validate the potential for threat to induce attitudinal shifts towards liberalism, and only one that does so in an environmental context 15 , evidencing a need for more thorough investigations of the relationship between threat and political orientation both broadly and within the context of climate change 18 , 23 . This study addresses the ongoing demand for research in this area by examining the influence of threat perception and fear on climate concern across the political spectrum, offering both practical and theoretical insights into this previously neglected relationship. A robust body of research indicates that political conservatives in the U.S. perceive lower climate risk, express more climate skepticism, and exhibit greater distrust in climate science compared to liberals 6 , 7 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27  and moderates 28 . In recent years, this trend has been increasingly mirrored internationally, with similar polarized attitudes observed across Canada 29 , Western Europe 5 , Latin America 30 , and Australia 31 , with the most pronounced effects occurring in countries with a left-right political divide analogous to that of the United States 5 , 32 . One explanation for this divide is differences in threat perception between liberals and conservatives across two dimensions—intent and extent 19 . While conservatives are primarily concerned by local and intentional threats with malicious intent, liberals are concerned by global threats resulting from passivity or inaction 19 , 23 . These differences may be a reflection of the values underlying conservatism and liberalism 33 , 34 , 35 , particularly regarding preferences for stability versus change, respectively 11 , 36 . Thus, ideological differences in threat prioritization may underlie the increased climate concern observed among liberals—given that climate change is a global threat perpetuated through indirect anthropogenic processes 19 , 37 . In line with this model, and to establish that results from a new online survey yield similar results to prior research, we hypothesize that  compared to liberals, moderates and especially conservatives have lower levels of climate concern (H1) . Fear related to climate change appears to influence risk perceptions and policy support (for a summary, see ref.  4 ). Findings from both neurological 38  and survey-based research 39  reveal strong associations between risk perception and incidental emotion. Within the context of climate change, worry is associated with greater perceptions of environmental risks 40 , 41 , the importance of global warming as a voting issue 42 , climate policy support 24 , adaptive behavior 43 , 44 , and information seeking 45 , 46 , 47 . For some outcomes, climate concern remains a strong predictor of behavior even after accounting for political orientation 42 , 44 , suggesting that conservatives who adopt more liberal attitudes towards climate change will reflect their beliefs with commensurate behaviors. However, due to the abstract nature of climate change, galvanizing public concern for climate threats is difficult 3  without emphasizing the relationship between local, tangible climate experiences and the broader phenomenon of global warming 2 , 48 , 49 . Among climate hazards, environmental disasters have a unique affective potency owing to their capacity for substantial, proximal harms 50 , 51 . Drawing from relevant disaster literature (for a summary, see 52 , 53 ), climate scientists typically categorize environmental disasters into two categories with respect to their causal structure 54 , 55 , 56 : natural disasters (e.g., floods, droughts, wildfires, hurricanes) and anthropogenic environmental disasters (e.g., pollution, oil spills, industrial accidents, dam failures). While natural disasters represent uncontrollable and unpredictable consequences of climate change, anthropogenic environmental disasters, by contrast, are controllable hazards that perpetuate the process of climate change 57 . Due to their inverse causal relationships to climate change and shared destructive capacities, both categories of disasters increase negative affect and concern for climate change—albeit through distinct mechanisms (for natural disasters, see refs.  58 , 59 ; for anthropogenic disasters, see refs.  49 , 55 , 60 ). While a comprehensive evaluation of the perceptual differences between natural and anthropogenic disasters is outside the scope of this paper, we nonetheless differentiate these constructs in accordance with the literature. Survey and experimental evidence overwhelmingly establish that the general population not only differentiates these disaster categories based on their perceived causes—ascribing ethical concerns to disasters directly involving human activity 55 —but additionally differentiates their ecological consequences, believing natural disasters to have less environmental impact than anthropogenic disasters 61 . Despite these differences, however, concern for both disaster categories is positively correlated with ecological risk perceptions 61 , suggesting a relationship to climate concern. In agreement with this line of research, we hypothesize that  fear of natural and anthropogenic disasters is associated with increased levels of climate concern (H2) . A primary function of political systems is their ability to address societal threats, with political ideologies providing frameworks for how these threats are prioritized and resolved 19 . The study of individual ideological preferences, then, necessitates an understanding of how threats—and the solutions afforded by political parties—are perceived 19 , 62 , 63 . The dominant theoretical perspectives examining this relationship have described a universal association between threats and preferences for political conservatism 64 , 65 , 66 . Recent research, however, increasingly challenges these seminal models, suggesting they empirically fail to replicate 20 , 67 , 68 , draw overgeneralized conclusions 69 , and disproportionately use threat stimuli that privilege conservative values 15 , 21 , 22 , 70 . Instead, modern perspectives have begun to adopt models that understand the relationship between threat and ideology as contextual to both the type of threat and the capacity for an ideology to resolve the threat 17 , 64 , 70 , 71 , demonstrating an association between certain types of threat and preferences for political liberalism 15 . As left-wing parties are internationally perceived as responsible for resolving climate-based threats 72 , these models predict that individuals who feel threatened by environmental disasters will adopt more liberal climate attitudes—as a threat is inherently accompanied by unpleasant emotions that motivate individual actors to find a solution 18 , 19 , 46 , 63 . Prior research into the influence of emotion on threat perception demonstrates that fear increases perceptions of risk and vulnerability 73 , 74 , especially within the context of climate-based threats 49 , 75 . As discussed above, conservatives who experience high levels of climate fear may be motivated to adopt more liberal attitudes towards climate change in response to the perceived threat, even if it requires the endorsement of ideologically inconsistent beliefs 15 , 18 , 19 , 76 , 77 . By extension, fear is unlikely to shift the attitudes of liberals and moderates, who ostensibly already hold liberal attitudes towards climate change 7 , 28  and behave accordingly 44 . Given the growing body of evidence supporting the ability of threats to induce liberal attitudes, we hypothesize that  the positive association between fear of environmental and natural disasters and climate concern is more pronounced for moderates and especially conservatives relative to liberals  (H3). To address our hypotheses, we utilize data from the SPEER23 Survey 78 —a comprehensive online survey administered by Qualtrics. Participants were recruited from existing Qualtrics panels using an “opt-in” sampling strategy. Panelists were recruited from a variety of sources and received compensation in accordance with the terms of their agreement with Qualtrics. Panelists were invited to participate via email or through the Qualtrics platform. The data collection process adhered to the relevant guidelines and regulations set forth by the University of Oklahoma Institutional Research Board, and followed the protocols outlined in Approval #15823. All participants provided informed consent prior to their participation. The survey respondents comprised 2188 adults (aged 18 and above) residing in the United States. Qualtrics employed quota-based recruitment strategies to ensure that the sample approximated a representative sample of U.S. adults, aligning with census benchmarks for age, gender, race/ethnicity, education level, and geographic region. Consequently, the data set offers a large and diverse sample that is generally representative of the broader U.S. adult population. Tables  1  and  2  present the results of regression analyses for the relationship between fear and political orientation across the four domains of climate concern. Visual depictions of the distributions of the dependent variables and fear scales are displayed in Figs.  1  and  2 . Across all baseline results (shown in Models 1a, 2a in Table  1  and 3a, and 4a in Table  2 ), compared to liberal orientation, moderate, and especially conservative orientation is negatively associated with all four climate concern dependent variables (supporting H1)—which is consistent with past literature. Baseline results also show that fear of environmental disasters is positively associated with all four climate concern domains—more so than any of the other fear variables. Fear of natural disasters is positively associated with climate risk, importance, and worry, but not belief in climate change alone. These results largely support Hypothesis 2. Interestingly, fear of strangers and fear of crime both negatively predict endorsement of climate risk and importance (albeit weakly), potentially due to their association with typically conservative threats 15 . Fear of human-made disasters and fear of personal tragedy are unrelated to climate concern. The distribution for each dependent variable is mostly normally distributed. The distribution for the climate belief dependent variable displayed in ( a ) is mostly normal with only a slight negative skew. Similarly, the distribution for the climate risk dependent variable in ( b ) is mostly normal with a slight negative skew. The distribution for the climate importance dependent variable displayed in ( c ) is only somewhat normally distributed. The distribution for the climate worry dependent variable displayed in ( d ) is mostly normal. The distribution for each dependent variable is mostly normally distributed. The distribution for the fear of natural disasters scale displayed in ( a ) is normal. The distribution for the fear of environmental disasters scale displayed in ( b ) is mostly normal with a slight negative skew. Models 1b and 2b in Table  1  and 3b and 4b in Table  2  show interaction results for fear of natural disasters and political orientation on climate concern. Across all analyses (and in line with Hypothesis 3), significance tests for the slopes of the interaction terms show that fear of natural disasters increases climate concern among conservatives relative to liberals. To ease interpretation, we display the interaction results graphically. Results in Fig.  3  show that natural disaster fear has little effect in motivating liberals and moderates to adopt higher levels of climate concern across all four dependent variables. However, as hypothesized, fear of natural disasters greatly bolsters climate concern for conservatives. While regression results for interaction terms can indicate significance in the slope of a particular interaction effect, further testing is needed to test for moderation at specific levels of the independent variables. For instance, while the coefficient for the interaction effects between moderates and liberals when interacting with natural disaster fear is only significant for one dependent variable (climate importance), marginal tests performed at each level of the natural disaster fear scale reveal significance between liberals and moderates at lower levels of fear relative to higher levels of fear for the other dependent variables. Results displayed in  a  show that climate belief is roughly even across all levels of disaster fear for liberals and moderates.Conservatives, however, have higher levels of climate belief as disaster fear increases. The same basic pattern is shown in  b  with predicted levels of climate risk. Results in both  c ,  d , demonstrate that disaster fear increases climate importance and climate worry for all political orientations—however, the positive effect of disaster fear on climate importance and worry is greater for conservatives relative to liberals and moderates. Overall, interaction plots for fear of natural disasters and political orientation show convergence among political orientations at higher levels of disaster fear when predicting climate concern. To empirically test how political orientation moderates the effect of natural disaster fear on climate concern, we conduct a series of post-hoc tests for marginal estimates across varying levels of the fear scales. For all four measures of climate concern, all three orientations significantly differ at low and middle levels of concern, with liberals exhibiting the highest degree of concern for all dependent variables, followed by moderates and conservatives. Climate importance no longer significantly differs between liberals and moderates at a value of eight on the natural disaster fear scale and a value of nine for the other three dependent variables. Moderates and conservatives no longer differ in climate belief and importance at a value of eight on the disaster scale and no longer differ in climate risk and worry at a value of nine. Liberals and conservatives show no significant difference in climate belief and importance at a value of nine on the natural disaster scale and are no different in climate risk and worry at the highest level of fear. To further demonstrate the relative convergence on climate concern for conservatives relative to liberals and moderates, we also report predicted scores on all dependent variables at the 25th and 75th percentiles for the natural disaster fear scale. Marginal estimates for the climate belief scale range from 2.59 (conservatives) to 3.16 (liberals) at the 25th percentile on the natural disaster fear scale. At the 75th percentile, the marginal estimates are much closer—ranging from 2.82 to 3.09. Marginal estimates for the climate risk scale at the 25th percentile on the disaster fear scale range between 2.45 (conservatives) and 3.06 (liberals). At the 75th percentile, marginal estimates range from 2.70 to 3.04. At the 25th percentile on the disaster fear scale, marginal estimates fall between 2.39 (conservatives) and 2.86 (liberals). The marginal estimates are much closer at the 75th percentile—ranging between 2.64 and 2.77. Finally, marginal estimates for climate worry at the 25th percentile of the disaster fear scale fall between 2.17 (conservatives) and 2.68 (liberals). At the 75th percentile, marginal estimates are between 2.44 and 2.76. To summarize, as natural disaster fear increases, political orientation matters less in predicting climate concern. Interaction results for the slope of fear of environmental disasters and orientation on climate concern are less consistent and only somewhat supportive of Hypothesis 3. Results on the effects of the slopes of the interaction terms in Models 1c and 2c of Table  1  show that fear of environmental disasters significantly increases belief in climate change and climate risk among moderates and conservatives relative to liberals. Graphical interpretations of interaction effects displayed in Fig.  4  demonstrate that fear of environmental disasters increases scores on climate belief and risk more starkly for conservatives (and moderates to some degree) relative to liberals. Results for tests of significance between slopes of the interaction terms shown in Models 3c and 4c of Table  2  only partially support Hypothesis 3. Fear of environmental disasters does not affect climate importance and worry differently between liberals and conservatives. The slope of the interaction term for moderates, however, shows marginally higher scores on climate importance for moderates relative to liberals as fear of environmental disasters increases. The findings for the interaction effects of environmental fear are graphically depicted in Fig.  4 . Results displayed in  a  demonstrate that environmental fear increases climate belief for all political orientationss, though more prominently for conservatives.  b  shows that climate risk increases for all political orientations as environmental fear increases, but more so for conservatives and especially moderates relative to liberals. Results displayed in  c  show a similar positive relationship between environmental fear and climate importance for liberals and conservatives, while the effect is more pronounced for moderates. Results displayed in  d  show that climate worry increases slightly more for moderates compared to liberals and conservatives as environmental fear increases. Results of marginal effects again provide nuance when evaluating how political orientation interacts with environmental fear in predicting climate concern. Results on climate belief show significant differences between all three political orientations at low and middle levels of environmental fear, with liberals scoring highest in climate belief, followed by moderates and conservatives. Climate belief is no longer significantly different between liberals and moderates at a score of eight on the environmental fear scale. Moderates and conservates no longer significantly differ at a level of nine on the scale. Liberals and conservatives no longer differ on climate belief at a level of ten on the environmental fear scale. For both the climate risk and climate worry DVs, liberals score significantly higher than moderates at lower and middle levels of environmental fear and then converge at a score of eight on the scale. Liberals score significantly higher in climate risk and climate worry relative to conservatives across all levels of environmental fear, demonstrating no significant interaction. Results for climate risk show that liberals score significantly higher than moderates at low and middle scores of environmental fear and then no longer significantly different at a score of eight. Moderates and conservatives do not significantly vary at the lowest levels of environmental fear, however, moderates exhibit higher levels of worry at scores of three and above on the scale. Liberals demonstrate significantly higher levels of climate worry than conservatives across all levels of environmental fear, showing no interaction effect. As with results for natural disaster fear, we report marginal estimates across dependent variables at the 25th and 75th percentiles of environmental fear to provide more context. Marginal estimates for climate change at the 25th percentile of environmental fear range from 2.44 (conservatives) to 3.03 (liberals). At the 75th percentile, marginal estimates range from 3.02 to 3.35. For climate risk, marginal estimates range between 2.26 and 2.87 at the 25th percentile for conservatives and liberals, respectively. At the 75th percentile, estimates range between 2.95 and 3.37. For climate importance, marginal estimates at the 25th percentile on the environmental fear scale fall between 2.21 (conservatives) and 2.66 (liberals). Marginal estimates range between 2.83 and 3.20 at the 75th percentile. Finally, marginal estimates for climate worry at the 25th percentile of environmental fear range from 1.99 for conservatives to 2.47 for liberals. At the 75th percentile, marginal estimates fall between 2.66 and 3.07. In sum, while not as robust as the findings on natural disaster fear, we find substantial political convergence on climate concern as environmental fear increases. In this study, we find compelling support for both Hypothesis 1 and Hypothesis 2. In line with a robust body of literature (e.g., refs.  7 , 8 , 24 , 28 , 79 ), we find that conservatives, on average, express far lower concern for climate issues relative to liberals and moderates. We also find that fear of both natural and anthropogenic environmental disasters is generally associated with increased climate concern—which is consistent with prior findings (e.g., refs.  55 , 58 , 59 , 75 ). Results for Hypothesis 3 yield mixed support. While conservatives experience a more pronounced association between climate concern and fear of natural disasters, climate worry, and climate importance do not differ much across political orientations when considering fear of environmental disasters. Despite this, as levels of fear increase, conservatives do experience more pronounced growth in climate belief and climate risk compared to liberals, suggesting differences in the affective versus cognitive assessments made of threats induced by environmental disasters. One explanation for the positive relationships observed between fear of anthropogenic environmental disasters and the affective components of climate concern across all political orientations can be found within relevant disaster literature. A large body of research suggests that anthropogenic environmental disasters are perceived as markedly more threatening 56  and severe 55  than natural disasters due to the attribution of blame afforded by the causal involvement of humans 53 , 54 , 60 . In addition to fear, such risk assessments may instead be mediated by anger, which is known to increase perceptions of threat and motivate behavioral responses independently of other emotions 15 , 52 , 60 , 63 , increasing climate risk perceptions relative to natural disasters 73 , 74 . As emotions tend to co-occur, anger may represent a confounding variable in the relationship between fear of disasters and climate concern 15 , 47 . Accordingly, anger may explain the mixed support observed for Hypothesis 3, as the influence of anger on perceived threats from anthropogenic disasters may increase perceptions of climate risks across all political orientations. Recent research indicates that threats associated with particularly strong negative emotions may be more effective at motivating attitudinal shifts, as taking action to resolve a salient threat (e.g., acknowledging potential solutions, adopting new perspectives, etc.) relieves the associated psychological discomfort 18 , 63 . While this study did not directly assess for this relationship or provide a measure for strong negative emotion, our findings are nonetheless consistent with the literature, and suggest a need for further research capable of elucidating the influence of discrete emotion on climate threat perception 19 . Theoretically, this study has important implications for ongoing investigations into the relationship between threat perception and political orientation. Our findings contribute to a growing body of literature challenging the seminal theoretical foundations of the present field (e.g 12 .), providing much-needed data synthesizing relationships between threat, emotion, and political orientation while confirming the capacity for threat to induce preferences for aspects of liberalism 18 , 19 , 23 . Generally, existing literature synthesizing threat perception and political orientation has demonstrated extreme bias toward traditionally conservative threats, leaving a large gap in the literature concerning the effects of liberal threats on political attitudes 15 , 18 . We observe that perceptions of environmental threats are significantly predictive of climate concern among conservatives while having little influence on liberals, indicating a shift towards liberal climate attitudes among conservatives at the highest levels of fear. This finding provides support for the ideology-affordance model of threat and politics 63 , which proposes that experiencing threat motivates an attitudinal alignment with the political ideology perceived as most capable of providing a resolution. In the context of climate change, this model demonstrates that conservatives who feel threatened by environmental disasters are motivated to adopt politically liberal climate attitudes, as liberals are seen as responsible for solving climate-related threats. While our findings are primarily relevant to the political landscape of the United States, research on issue ownership has revealed that the threats associated with different political parties are relatively stable cross-culturally, suggesting the ability of this model to retain predictive power internationally 72 . However, as research on the capacity for threat to evoke preferences for liberalism remains scarce, future studies should examine alternative threat stimuli relating to climate change, as well as investigate other historically neglected threats outside of a climate context that may elicit liberal ideological shifts 18 . Practically, our findings provide direction for climate communicators and policymakers looking to increase climate concern among conservatives and increase their behavioral responses to climate change. Principally, understanding the circumstances under which shifts in political preferences can occur is paramount to developing effective interventions 18 . Our study presents evidence that conservatives can be motivated to increase endorsements of climate concern under circumstances of environmental threat. If interventions can be designed to assist conservatives in connecting their understandings of local, salient climate threats (e.g., disasters) to the broader phenomenon of global warming, our study suggests that this may be associated with increased climate concern 2 , 48 , 49 . Increased climate concern across the domains of belief, worry, risk perception, and importance are well-correlated with a variety of behavioral outcomes. Worry about climate change consistently predicts its importance as a voting issue, even after accounting for political orientation 62 , and is correlated with support for climate policies—as are climate risk perceptions and belief in climate change 24 , 40 , 43 . Perception of climate risks is strongly associated with adaptive behavioral intentions 43 . Belief in climate change is further associated with climate action for both conservatives and liberals 44 , as political polarization does not translate into differences in behavioral outcomes. Given the clear potential for behavioral outcomes, future research should seek to utilize the present findings to both design more effective interventions (e.g., messaging and awareness campaigns) and to confirm the relationship between climate concern and behavior across the political spectrum. Climate communicators and policymakers should additionally be mindful of the potential risks associated with increasing concern for climate change in the absence of accessible behavioral responses. If individuals do not feel that climate-friendly behaviors are available, convenient, or effective—both personally and politically—they may not elect to change their behaviors even when experiencing high levels of concern about climate change (for a summary, see ref.  79 ). High levels of climate concern in the absence of a conspicuous solution may subsequently increase the belief that climate change is unstoppable, which is associated with reduced behavioral outcomes, including decreased desire for mitigatory policies 80 . Thus, groups or individuals seeking to increase behavioral responses to climate change should remain aware of the importance of providing accessible opportunities for pro-climate behavior in addition to any efforts to increase climate concern. Through outlining both proximal ecological threats to personal safety and encouraging the consideration of relationships between local experiences and climate change, our findings suggest that future climate initiatives may successfully increase climate concern among historically resistant groups, such as political conservatives. Pairing this concern with explicit behavioral recommendations or instruction may be a fruitful avenue for future research. Given the nature of the data, this study has some additional methodological and statistical limitations worth considering. To begin, there are noted discrepancies in samples between traditional secondary surveys (e.g., General Social Survey and American National Election Survey) and online, opt-in surveys 81 . While Qualtrics met most demographic targets within range to provide an approximated representative sample, we note that our sample still skews toward liberals and undercounts conservatives and Republicans—an issue that is common with many online surveys and political polls 82 . Additionally, we are limited by the measures available. For example, 37 percent of respondents identify as politically independent. Other research 83  notes that independents usually lean toward one party or the other—meaning very few Americans are truly independent. We have no measure to discern those who lean in an ideological direction from true independents, thus there may be some political misclassification for our political affiliation control. Furthermore, the available survey items only allow us to evaluate attitudes toward climate concerns. Survey questions that assess actual behaviors would provide more meaningful measurement. Finally, while we find statistical significance for our interaction terms, the interaction models do not add much-explained variance to the models as a whole. Much of the variance in climate concern appears to be attributed to the direct effects of the independent variables in the baseline models. The interaction models explain nuances within the focal relationships but do not substantively add to the model fit. Ultimately, understanding the psychological dynamics that influence political preferences is crucial for consolidating social support for climate action. By embracing nuanced approaches that acknowledge and address individuals’ fears and concerns, researchers can lay the groundwork for meaningful collective efforts to mitigate climate impacts. This study offers valuable and novel insights into the intricate interplay between fear, political orientation, and climate concern, illuminating promising avenues for future research initiatives. We use four linear dependent variables to measure varying dimensions of climate concern. Adapted from prior climate opinion surveys 84 , 85 , these variables measure belief in anthropogenic contributions to climate change (climate belief), perceptions of risk to people and the environment (climate risk), personal importance of climate change (climate importance), and worry about climate change (climate worry). These constructs are frequently used within climate research due to their ability to capture varying cognitive and experiential factors that independently influence climate threat perception and behavioral outcomes 4 , 24 , 42 , allowing for more thorough associations to be drawn with the extant literature. All four dependent variables are linear and were recoded to a scale of 1-4 to achieve a Gaussian or normal distribution. A correlation matrix for all DVs is provided in Supplementary Table  3 . A full description of survey item wording and general coding for all variables can be found in Supplementary Table  1  and descriptive statistics for all variables are provided in Supplementary Table  2 . Distributions for dependent variables and fear scales can be found in Table  1  and Table  2 , respectively. Independent variables include measures for fear and political orientation. We measure self-reported fear across six established domains based on items from Chapman University’s Survey of American Fears 86 . To comprehensively account for various types of fears, including those beyond environmental and climate concerns, our study assesses fear across six well-established domains. These domains were determined based on items from Chapman University’s Survey of American Fears 86 . Each of the six fears is measured with linear self-placement scales. Interaction terms are only created using the scales for disaster fear and environmental fear scales. We refer to environmental disasters as those that are caused by or related to human activity that primarily result in damage to the environment. In doing so, we draw from disaster classifications developed by risk and climate scientists to distinguish human-caused disasters from natural disasters, as well as use the Survey of American Fears 87  in our separation of disasters harming the environment (“Environmental Disasters,” e.g., pollution, industrial accidents) from those that primarily impact human populations (“Man-Made Disasters,” e.g., war, terrorism, pandemics). Separating disasters by consequence as well as causal structure is necessary to focus our analysis on only disasters related directly to the environment, thus avoiding confounding influences on their relationship to climate concern. Environmental fear is modeled with fear of disasters for all analyses. A bivariate correlation test ( r  = 0.616) indicates a strong correlation between the two types of fear. Given this correlation, a post-hoc test of multicollinearity (performed on the baseline model without interaction terms) shows an overall mean VIF value of 1.61. VIF values for the environmental and disaster scales are 2.21 and 2.13, respectively. This finding demonstrates that the variance of the coefficients is inflated by 121% and 113%, respectively, due to multicollinearity with other variables in the model. These results demonstrate no serious issues with multicollinearity in the model. The original political orientation variable assesses self-placement on a 7-point scale from “very liberal” to “very conservative”. Responses were coded into three dummy variables for liberal, moderate, and conservative by collapsing the liberal and conservative endpoints together—leaving the moderate category for respondents who indicated no ideological “lean.” Extant climate literature generally categorizes political orientation along a liberal-conservative dichotomy, with little explicit consideration given to political moderates. We include moderates for more robust analysis and to address a gap in the literature on politics and climate attitudes. Interaction terms are created by multiplying scales of fears of both natural disasters and environmental disasters by moderate and conservative dummy variables (with liberal as the reference category). In each model, we include a full array of control variables for political party, age, sex, race, socio-economic status, family status, religious variables, and subjective weather perception (see Supplementary Table  1  for more detail on coding). Analyses are conducted using OLS regressions modeled in Stata. Baseline models report regression coefficients for all focal and control independent variables. Subsequent models include regression effects for interaction terms between political orientation and both fear of natural disasters and fear of environmental disasters. Graphical figures are displayed to aid in the interpretation of significant interaction effects based on model results. We replicate OLS regressions with ordinal logistic regressions. Given that the results are remarkably consistent, we employ OLS regression for ease of interpretation and to more accurately report the amount of variance explained in each model.

In January, the catastrophic fires that erupted in Los Angeles and displaced more than 200,000 residents brought devastation. These disasters underscored the importance of understanding homeowners insurance for current homeowners and those looking to purchase a home. Insurance is critical to ensuring that your most valuable asset is protected. Homeowners insurance policies provide financial protection against damage to your home and personal belongings caused by events such as fire, theft, vandalism, and some natural disasters. It includes liability coverage, which protects you in case someone is injured on your property. While homeowners insurance typically covers common perils, it’s important to note that not all-natural disasters like floods or earthquakes are included in standard policies. These often require additional coverage. If you’re taking out a mortgage to purchase a home, your lender will almost always require homeowners insurance to protect their investment. Even if you’re buying a home outright, having a policy is essential for safeguarding your financial security. Need a break?   Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle. When selecting a homeowners insurance policy, it’s important to understand the two common types of reimbursement: It is worth noting that many insurers will no longer cover a roof that is over 10 years old due to the prevalence of hail and wind damage in our area. This is important whether you are buying or preparing your home to sell. If you’re in the market to purchase a home, it’s imperative to start looking at policies early and consult with a Realtor who can connect you with a licensed insurance agent to help guide you through the process. A proactive approach to securing the right insurance coverage can save you significant stress — and money — when the unexpected occurs. As natural disasters continue to impact communities across the country, we’re reminded of the power of coming together to support one another.

To my recollection, over 40,000 acres have burned in southern California and thousands of homes have been destroyed. My sister reports that she had two to three inches of snow in Houston, with below freezing temperatures. For the first time in a long time, local schools were closed, not due to ice and snow, but to below zero temperatures and low wind-chill temperatures. Now, with rain coming, many Californians are afraid of mud slides. With these and other natural disasters, one wonders if it will ever end. What should we make of it? I’ve heard some tell me that these disasters are predicting in the Bible as a sure sign of the end times. “Jesus is soon coming!” They quote the Bible mentioning earthquakes, wars, fires and flood. Some are really scared. These may be the last days, or not. Natural disasters have always been happening. These events don’t seem to be anything new. However, it is easy for us to get distracted by natural disasters. While focusing on these events we don’t focus on other issues. What about joblessness, homelessness, hunger, poverty, and sickness, including mental illness? What about anxiety, depression, and loneliness? What about focusing on our own sinfulness and need for healing and forgiveness? In The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, Steven Covey says that we ought to focus on things we can do something about. Usually these are issues that are near to us. How about doing something locally? Volunteer, join a Bible study, or a local charitable group like the Lions Club, Knights of Columbus or the Kiwanis Club? What about becoming a Big Brother or Sister? What about donating to the local fire department or veteran’s organization? Give blood. A major concern of mine is that I’ve heard from reputable sources that ICE is not only rounding up violent illegal immigrants, but everyone that is undocumented. Many people who have created lives for over twenty years in this country are being deported. What is to happen to their families? Even Ronald Reagan made it possible for many who came to this country illegally to get citizenship. I’m worried. Please pray, and call our elected officials to do all they can to prevent this immoral deportation. It is one thing to deport someone with a record of violence and quite another to deport those who have established a better life and have become integral members of our community and families. “May the Lord bless and keep you. May he let his face shine upon you, be gracious to you and give you his peace.”", "metadata": {"published_date": "2025-02-07T14:33:44+00:00", "author": "Unknown", "source": "Wilcox Newspapers"}}

The storm made landfall on Saturday in the country’s north with wind speeds reaching 213 kilometres (133 miles) per hour, causing severe flooding and landslides, and forcing the evacuation of over 50,000 people. As of Wednesday, at least 179 people are reported to have been killed, including children, according to media reports. Several hundred people have been injured and over 47,500 houses damaged or destroyed. “The strength and intensity of  the typhoon has left a trail of catastrophic consequences, with millions of families severely affected  in coastal as well as mountainous and hard-to-reach areas,” the UN Children’s Fund ( UNICEF ) said in a  bulletin , issued late on Monday. The agency estimates that 5.5 million children are among the 19 million people living in the most affected regions. In response, authorities have launched a comprehensive relief effort, deploying more than 438,000 officials, soldiers, disaster response experts and volunteers. The Government has also invited the support of all disaster response and humanitarian actors, including UNICEF, to support the response. UNICEF is actively coordinating with UN entities and partners to assess needs and provide urgent support in areas such as child protection, water and sanitation, nutrition, health, and education. “ A supply plan has been activated to mobilise pre-positioned essential supplies , at the national level and in warehouses across the region, and through [our] global supply division, if needed,” the agency added. Typhoon Yagi’s path of destruction also extended to neighbouring countries, with casualties and damage reported in the Philippines and China. Twenty-one fatalities were recorded in the Philippines by the national disaster management authorities, with 26 people still missing as of Wednesday. In China, media reported that four people were killed and about 100 injured across the Hainan Island in the south. The combined effects of the monsoon and tropical disturbances also resulted in flash floods in northern Lao People’s Democratic Republic and Thailand. Over 1.5 million people have been affected in the Philippines, where a state of calamity was declared this week in Metro Manila and nearby areas, as Super Typhoon Gaemi swept through the island nation, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OHCA) has reported.

About a week after Typhoon Shanshan  struck southern Japan , a powerful storm is bearing down on southern China. Typhoon Yagi first emerged northwest of Palau in late August and struck the island of Luzon in the Philippines as a tropical storm on September 2, causing destructive  flash flooding and landslides . The island’s rugged terrain weakened Yagi temporarily, but the storm then strengthened rapidly as it moved over the South China Sea and encountered  unusually warm water  and favorable atmospheric conditions. When the  MODIS  (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) on NASA’s  Terra  satellite captured this image of Yagi at 10:12 a.m. local time (02:12 Universal Time) on September 5, the storm was tracking westward with maximum sustained winds of 225 kilometers (145 miles) per hour, making it the equivalent of a  Category 4 hurricane  and one of the strongest tropical cyclones yet in 2024. Forecasters expect Yagi to continue moving westward, making landfall in Hainan or neighboring Guangdong province on the morning of September 6. Chinese officials bracing for the storm have closed schools, postponed flights, and closed offices, according to  news reports .

Main UNESCO website UNESCO Digital Library website. The Value of water Groundwater, making the invisible visible UNESCO Story In 2022, the United Nations Secretary-General  António Guterres declared that ‘all people on Earth must be protected by early warning systems within five years’. He launched the Early Warnings for All initiative the same year to make this a reality by 2027. In the Pacific, the regionally led Weather Ready Pacific Programme endorsed by the Pacific Leaders Forum in 2021 is the key vehicle for delivering the Early Warnings for All initiative. The Early Warnings for All initiative itself complements other roadmaps designed to reduce disaster risk. In the Pacific, there is  the  2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent  (2022) and  the  Framework for Resilient Development in the Pacific  (2016) adopted by the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders.  At global level, there is  The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development  (2015) and the  Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015 –2030  adopted by the United Nations.  All of these strategies have one thing in common: they identify strengthening early warning systems as being a critical component of building resilience to disasters and, by extension, contributing to sustainable development. The  Early Warnings for All initiative  comprises four pillars: acquiring knowledge, including via risk assessments; detection, monitoring and forecasting; communicating warnings; and preparedness and response. The Pacific geohazards community is aligning its efforts with both the  Early Warnings for All initiative  and the Weather Ready Pacific Programme.  However, to do so effectively, it will be necessary to develop a regional geohazards strategy to improve coordination and unlock the resources needed to reduce geohazard risk in the Pacific. Preventive measures need not be expensive. By protecting mangrove forests along the coast, for instance, we can ensure that they attenuate the impact of tsunami waves. By respecting building codes, we can make buildings more resistant to earthquakes, including hospitals and schools. Remember, earthquakes don’t kill, collapsing buildings do. Did you know that it was UNESCO’s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission which set up the first International Tsunami Information Center in Hawaii in 1965 as part of the new tsunami early warning system?  The Pacific Ocean Basin was chosen for this first centre,  owing to its great vulnerability to this type of geohazard.                                                    The International Tsunami Information Center complements the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, also in Hawaii. Together, they are at the heart of the Pacific  Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System.  Following  the 17 December earthquake in Vanuatu, it was the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center which  provided national tsunami warning centres with bulletins advising them that there was no imminent threat of a tsunami. The inhabitants of Banda Aceh were not so lucky. As they lived just 65 km from the epicentre of the underwater earthquake in December 2004, Aceh was hit by shockwaves just half an hour after the earthquake occurred. Even had an early warning system been in place in the Indian Ocean at the time, the Banda Aceh population could not have been alerted to the tsunami in time but tremor and tidal gauges, rapid data transfer, alarm mechanisms and training in the danger zones would have provided ample time for coastal inhabitants to flee to higher ground in the other countries hit by the tsunami over the next 12 hours.  Since the 2004 catastrophe, UNESCO has opened the Indian Ocean Tsunami Information Centre which it hosts in Jakarta, Indonesia. UNESCO and its partners plan to accelerate plans for the region’s own multigeohazard early warning system at a regional workshop in Apia on 24–28 February 2025.

Changes in precipitation can substantially disrupt crops and livestock, influence the frequency and intensity of severe weather events, and affect the quality and quantity of water available for municipal and industrial use. Snow drought  is a period of abnormally low snowpack for the time of year. Snowpack typically acts as a natural reservoir, providing water throughout the drier summer months. Lack of snowpack storage, or a shift in timing of snowmelt, can be a challenge for drought planning.  Periods of drought can lead to inadequate  water supply , threatening the health, safety, and welfare of communities. Streamflow, groundwater, reservoir, and snowpack data are key to monitoring and forecasting water supply. In a drought, lower water levels or snowpack can affect the availability of  recreational  activities and associated  tourism , and a resulting loss of revenue can severely impact supply chains and the economy. Drought—as well as negative perceptions of drought, fire bans, or wildfires—may also result in decreased visitations, cancellations in hotel stays, a reduction in booked holidays, or reduced merchandise sales.  Drought is defined as the lack of  precipitation  over an extended period of time, usually for a season or more, that results in a water shortage. Changes in precipitation can substantially disrupt crops and livestock, influence the frequency and intensity of severe weather events, and affect the quality and quantity of water available for municipal and industrial use. Snow drought  is a period of abnormally low snowpack for the time of year. Snowpack typically acts as a natural reservoir, providing water throughout the drier summer months. Lack of snowpack storage, or a shift in timing of snowmelt, can be a challenge for drought planning.  Periods of drought can lead to inadequate  water supply , threatening the health, safety, and welfare of communities.

We acknowledge that conditions are evolving. Abnormally warm and dry conditions throughout December led to persistent and worsening snow drought across most of Arizona, New Mexico, southwestern Utah, and southwestern Colorado. Though El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) neutral conditions remain, a weather pattern similar to La Niña left many parts of the Southwest with no precipitation in December and over 150% of normal precipitation in the Pacific Northwest. In the southern Sierra Nevada, snowpack fell to well-below-normal values. There was some improvement over the past 30 days in early snow drought conditions in much of western Montana, northern Wyoming, and northern Utah. Isolated areas of snow drought persist in the Cascade Range, mostly at lower elevations. Above-normal December mean temperatures, reaching record highs in some areas, contributed to more precipitation falling as rain versus snow at lower elevations and limited snowpack accumulation in some areas of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Range.  Jump to conditions for your region: Key Takeaway:  The Southwest faces severe snow drought conditions with some SNOTEL stations reporting record low snow water equivalent (SWE).  Key Takeaway:   Basins across Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico saw exceptionally dry conditions in the past 30 days. Precipitation was between 0% and 50% of average.  Most of the northern Rocky Mountains saw improvement in early season snow drought conditions with a more active weather pattern over the last 30 days. Snow drought persists in the southern Rocky Mountains, primarily in basins in southern Utah and southwestern Colorado, which could lead to expanded drought conditions.  Snow drought conditions are currently present in portions of western Montana and northern Wyoming due to warm and dry conditions through most of December. The Bighorn, Upper Yellowstone, and Upper Missouri basins have the lowest snowpack in the region with current snow water equivalent (SWE) at 75%, 84%, and 87% of normal, respectively. Some recent improvements reflect a more active weather pattern that brought much colder temperatures since late December. Idaho and Wyoming saw notable improvements, with some areas moving entirely out of snow drought over the past month.  The mountains in southwestern Utah (Pine Valley Range and Markagunt Plateau) and areas in southern Colorado are currently experiencing snow drought. Most SNOTEL stations in southwestern Utah currently have less than 50% of normal snow water equivalent (SWE). Several sites, including the Gutz Peak (21-year period of record) and Harris Flat (45-year period of record) SNOTEL stations, report no snow at all; this is the first time this has occurred at Gutz Peak and for Harris Flat it also occurred in 1990 and 2018 . Snow drought conditions have greatly improved or been erased in portions of northern Utah over the past 30 days.  Central and northern Colorado SNOTEL stations are reporting above-average precipitation and average to just below-average SWE. Southern Colorado conditions are more variable, with the northwest portion of the San Juan Mountains reporting above-normal SWE and the southern portion of the range reporting below-normal SWE.  Region-wide exceptional snow drought conditions are present with all SNOTEL stations in Arizona and New Mexico reporting well-below-normal snow water equivalent (SWE). Most are reporting SWE values well below 50% of normal, and several sites are reporting no snow on the ground. Similarly dry conditions were recorded in 2021, 2019, 2006 and 2000. Most of New Mexico saw 0% of normal precipitation and record warm temperatures in the past 30 days. Well-above-normal temperatures induced snowmelt in some locations. For the first time on record, the Flagstaff Pulliam Airport received zero December precipitation (trace amounts were recorded in 1958, 1999, and 2017) while recording a monthly mean temperature 6.7 degrees above normal. These extremely warm and dry conditions contributed to both short- and long-term drought development in the region.    Key Takeaway:  Snow drought conditions are severe across Arizona due to above-average temperatures and significantly below-normal precipitation, reducing snow water equivalent (SWE) levels.   The typical Pacific Northwest early December winter dry spell ended with abundant high-elevation snowfall across most of Oregon and Washington, leaving parts of the central and southern Oregon Cascade Range and the Blue Mountains with snow water equivalent (SWE) greater than 150% (some stations reporting record high values). Exceptions to the otherwise well-above-normal snowpack include the Puget Sound basin in northwest Washington (near normal at 99% of median) and isolated areas of snow drought which exist at lower elevations (below 4,000 feet) between the central Oregon Cascade Range and the northern Washington Cascade Range. Abnormally wet conditions over the past month in much of Oregon and Washington were accompanied by well-above-normal temperatures, bringing rain rather than snow to lower elevations of the western Cascade Range.  The far southern Sierra Nevada (from Lone Pine southward) and the Spring Mountains in southern Nevada received very little precipitation over the past month with well-below-normal snow water equivalent (SWE). All three SNOTEL sites in the Spring Mountains are reporting no snow on the ground, which also occurred in 2018 for this date in the season (note these stations only have a 17-year period of record). Most of the active California Cooperative Snow Survey pillows south of Kings Canyon are reporting less than 50% of normal SWE. Moving north, conditions improve due to a sharp cutoff in the southern extent of the storm track, which brought snow and near-normal SWE in the central Sierra Nevada and much-above-normal SWE in the northern Sierra Nevada and southern Cascade Range. Snowpack is also much above normal in the Trinity Alps (northwestern California) and at higher elevations in the northern third of  Nevada, including the Jarbidge and Ruby Mountains. Snow drought conditions exist throughout the southcentral region of Alaska. As of January 5,  snow water equivalent (SWE) values in the Knik Arm, Kenai Peninsula, and Prince William Sound basins are 49%, 54%, and 47% of normal, respectively. Above-normal precipitation and warm temperatures over the past month occurred in locations near the immediate coast in the Kenai Peninsula, resulting in melting snowpack and development of warm snow drought conditions. As of January 5, the Mt. Alyeska SNOTEL station reported its lowest SWE on record (47 years of data), with only 3.8 inches of snow (27% of normal), causing a gradual loss of SWE throughout December. This is despite a total 9.9 inches of precipitation (121% of average) over the past 30 days. In southcentral Alaska, dry weather combined with warm temperatures is causing snow drought conditions. Snowpack is still above normal in the Fairbanks region and surrounding mountains, due to considerable late October snowfall. Key Takeaway:  Snow drought in the Kenai Peninsula began in mid-December due to warm temperatures causing rain at high elevations, limiting snowpack gains, and in some cases causing snowmelt. Snow water equivalent is below the tenth percentile despite seasonal precipitation being near normal.    * Quantifying snow drought values is an ongoing research effort.

Date: Tuesday, January 14, 2025 Contact:  Interior_Press@ios.doi.gov WASHINGTON  – The Department of the Interior today announced $223 million from President Biden’s Investing in America agenda for water recycling and desalination projects aimed at addressing the impacts of drought. The funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and annual appropriations is being awarded to 18 projects in eight states through the Title XVI Water Reclamation and Reuse and Desalination Programs. The selected projects are expected to result in 305,936 acre-feet of annual recycled water. President Biden’s Investing in America agenda represents the largest investment in climate resilience in the nation’s history and is providing much-needed resources to enhance Western communities’ resilience to drought and climate change. Through the  Bipartisan Infrastructure Law , the Bureau of Reclamation is investing a total of $8.3 billion over five years for water infrastructure projects, including rural water, water storage, conservation and conveyance, nature-based solutions, dam safety, water purification and reuse, and desalination. Since the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law was signed three years ago, Reclamation has announced almost $5.3 billion for more than 670 projects. “Access to clean and reliable water is essential for feeding families and communities, growing crops, sustaining wildlife and the environment, and powering agricultural businesses,” said  Secretary Deb Haaland.  \"The Biden-Harris administration has brought every resource to bear to ensure that we both minimize the impacts of climate-fueled drought and develop a long-term plan to build resilience and facilitate water conservation.” “With these historic investments, we continue to work with our stakeholders to develop drought resiliency in western states through water reuse and desalination,”  Deputy Commissioner Roque Sanchez  said during a visit to one of the projects in Oklahoma today. “This allows for communities and water users to develop previously unusable water supplies to create a new local water supply that is less vulnerable to impacts of climate change and drought.” Sanchez visited the Foss Reservoir Master Conservancy District, which received $7.5 million for construction of its Drinking Water Pretreatment Rehabilitation Project. The district will upgrade its treatment process at the Foss Water Treatment Plant, which treats brackish Foss Reservoir source water. The upgrades are expected to increase the plant’s total capacity by about 25 percent, from approximately 1.8 million gallons per day to 2.3 million gallons per day. The increased reliability of Foss Reservoir and additional pretreated supply will further strengthen the district’s drought and climate change resilience. To view a full list of projects, visit  Reclamation’s website . Today’s funding builds upon several previous announcements under the program including  $142 million announced in June . ### This page was not helpful because the content: Please provide a comment 1849 C Street NW, Washington, DC 20240", "metadata": {"published_date": "Unknown", "author": "Unknown", "source": "U.S. Department of the Interior"}}

In 2023, climate disasters drove millions of the world’s most vulnerable women and girls from their homes, exposing them to threat of sexual and gender-based violence, harmful practices like child marriage and preventable death during pregnancy and childbirth. New data from UNFPA , the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency, and the  Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre  reveal that more than a third of displacements in 2023 involving women and girls and driven by crises such as floods, cyclones and earthquakes occurred in countries at the highest risk of climate emergencies, but least prepared for them. \"The climate crisis is making the world more dangerous for everyone, and in countries hardest hit, it is women and girls who suffer most,” said UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem. “As storms, floods, droughts and wildfires displace them from their homes, life-saving health services, safe spaces, education and livelihood opportunities can fall out of reach. Women and girls are on the front lines of the climate emergency, and this new analysis is a reminder that their needs must not be ignored.” See more on climate change’s severe impacts for women and girls Not all natural catastrophes can be planned for, and some may have no connection to climate change (although scientists are increasingly researching the links between  earthquakes and droughts ). But it is possible – and crucial – for societies to anticipate extreme weather events and disasters and include women and girls and their needs in emergency response planning. Here are three that humanitarian actors must prepare for when responding to a crisis. Just two natural disasters drove over one quarter of displacements in 2023: the twin earthquakes that rocked  Syria and Türkiye  in February, and Cyclone Mocha, which smashed into Myanmar and Bangladesh in May. Mother-of-five Azra* was one of more than 2 million women displaced by the catastrophic quakes in Türkiye. Left with few options for shelter, Yasmin was forced to move in with her husband, from whom she had filed for divorce by obtaining a restraining and protection order. Although this helped to protect her from the elements in the aftermath of the earthquakes, Yasmin’s vulnerability to another kind of harm arose in her husband’s home: his threats and abuse. With UNFPA support, she and her children were relocated to a women’s and girls’ safe space to stay. “We had to escape both the earthquake and my husband,”  she told UNFPA . “Thank God, he doesn’t know we’re here now. I know I am safe.” Months later, in advance of Cyclone Mocha’s devastating landfall in Bangladesh, UNFPA community volunteer Yasmin Akhter encouraged female refugees living at the Nayapara camp, where she is stationed, to take shelter at a UNFPA-supported women-friendly space. The facility, known as Shanti Khana – ‘the home of peace’ in English – also provided temporary refuge for female members of Ms. Akhter’s own family amid the pummeling winds and rain. “I am here to support the community, to make them aware of the potential threats that women and girls face, and how to prevent them,”  Ms. Akhter said . “Once I heard about the cyclone, it was impossible for me to stay home.\" Floods, tornados, hurricanes, earthquakes, wildfires: Childbirth doesn’t stop for any of these.  This is something Nasreen Faroug Balla knows very well, having gone into labour one month after rainy season floods swept across Gedaref State in Sudan in July 2022, cutting hundreds of villages off from access to essential services and healthcare. Once her labour pangs began, Ms. Faroug Balla had to be carried 3km through the rain and mud to reach a UNFPA-supported field hospital. In the delivery room, her blood pressure skyrocketed and she fainted; doctors rushed to perform an emergency Caesarean section.  “This field hospital saved my daughter’s life,”  Ms. Faroug Balla’s mother told UNFPA . “Without it, I do not think she would have survived.”  Thousands of kilometres south in Madagascar, 26-year-old Georgette also gave birth amid natural disaster, going into labour just as Tropical Cyclone Freddy ripped through her village in February 2023. Fortunately, Georgette wasn’t at home – she had evacuated to an emergency shelter before the cyclone made landfall. It was here, in the bathrooms of a converted school compound, that Georgette became a mother for a second time, naming her newborn son Freddy.  Midwife Lydia Rabitarivao, who was working at the UNFPA-supported health centre in Maroalakely, provided the mother and baby essential postnatal care. “Both are doing very well,”  Ms. Rabitarivao said . “We gave them the necessary first aid and went back in the afternoon for a check-up.” It is a common refrain amid displaced populations: “We fled with nothing.” Running for your life means leaving everything behind, from food, water and clothing to essential reproductive health supplies like birth control and menstrual pads. UNFPA works to fill these gaps and ensure women’s sexual and reproductive health needs in emergencies do not become afterthoughts. In the context of displacement, which often robs women and girls of their safety nets, livelihoods and health, the ability to  manage menstruation  and plan pregnancies can be literally life saving.  “Life is already difficult. We have to fight daily for survival,”  said 26-year-old Gabdaibe Thibothe , who visited the maternity ward at the Kalambari refugee camp in Chad in search of family planning services.  Kalambari hosts more than 9,000 people, many of whom fled neighbouring Cameroon after  conflict reignited  in 2021 over dwindling resources in the northeast – particularly water, which has become scarce amid  drought in the Lake Chad basin . “Thanks to the midwives’ awareness raising, I understood that by spacing out the births of children, families can better provide for their needs in terms of education and health,” Ms. Thibothe told UNFPA. Halfway around the world, Adriana Martínez Echavarría expressed a similar sentiment in the aftermath of Hurricane Ian, which made landfall in Cuba in September 2022 and tore the roof off the 20-year-old’s house. A medical biophysics student, Ms. Martínez Echavarría knew reproductive autonomy was critical to continuing her studies – but local pharmacies were out of the birth control tablets she’d been taking.  With UNFPA support, Ms. Martínez Echavarría obtained a contraceptive implant at the Turcios Lima clinic in Pinar del Río. “I’m about to graduate and I have many personal and professional and plans ahead of me,”  she told UNFPA . “It’s not that it’s a bad thing, but I don’t want to have children yet.”  “I hope that my children will arrive when I am able to receive them.” The 29th  United Nations Climate Change Conference  (COP29) is a pivotal opportunity to accelerate action to tackle the global climate crisis. At the event in Baku, Azerbaijan, UNFPA will call on global leaders to prioritize the needs of women and girls amid climate disasters; provide adequate financial support to vulnerable countries to address climate change impacts and build resilience; and to include women and youth in decision-making processes and leadership on climate action. *Names have been changed News Floods, cyclones and earthquakes caused over ⅓ of displacements involving women and girls in 2023.

The urgent intervention, funded by the federal government, aims to safeguard the coastal road and surrounding areas from further damage due to relentless high tides and monsoon conditions. Piasau assemblyman Datuk Sebastian Ting Chiew Yew disclosed this development during a press conference accompanied by Miri Mayor Adam Yii Siew Sang, who also serves as the Pujut assemblyman, today. Ting revealed that he had personally written to the deputy prime minister on January 16, highlighting the worsening erosion and the need for immediate remedial measures. His appeal was reinforced by discussions with Sarawak Minister for Transport Datuk Seri Lee Kim Shin and Sarawak United Peoples’ Party (SUPP) president Dato Amar Dr Sim Kui Hian. “I had expressed serious concerns about the impact of strong waves and high tides, which have already washed away parts of the road. If left unaddressed, the situation could escalate, leading to road collapse and endangering public safety,” Ting said. He further explained that while the federal government has allocated RM45 million for a long-term coastal protection project, the tender process for the design and build contract only closed on January 31. Given that such processes typically take months, he urged for emergency intervention to prevent further deterioration in the meantime. In response, Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Fadillah Yusof promptly instructed for temporary works to commence. While Ting had initially requested RM5 million for these immediate measures, the exact funding amount for the emergency works has not been disclosed. In parallel, the Sarawak Disaster Management Committee and Miri Disaster Management Committee are also exploring additional measures to bolster efforts in securing the affected area. Ting also confirmed that he had reached out to Miri police chief ACP Alexson Naga Chabu, requesting police assistance in placing warning signs at the affected site to alert the public. “This is a serious situation, and we cannot afford to wait. The waves, high tide, and rainy season pose an ongoing threat. We are very grateful to our deputy prime minister for his swift action in addressing this urgent matter,” he added. With emergency works now set to begin, authorities hope to stabilise the affected section of Lutong Beach while awaiting the implementation of the larger federal-funded coastal protection project. — DayakDaily   Get news  FASTER !

When measured over a long period, trends in mass balance are an indicator of climate change. The global net loss of glacier mass contributes to  sea level rise , whereas seasonal melting of ice and snow contributes to runoff, even in years with a positive annual mass balance [1] . Both globally and across Europe, glaciers have seen a substantial and prolonged loss of ice mass since the mid-19th century [2] . During the 20th century, the rate of loss was relatively low with intermittent periods of mass gain. Since the 1990s, glacier mass loss has been increasing; particularly since 2000 [3] . Figure 1.

Credit: C3S/ECMWF/WGMS. Globally, around 220,000 glaciers – distinct from the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets – cover an area of about 700,000 km 2  and have a volume of about 158,000 km 3 [5] . The majority of these glaciers are observed either in the field or using satellite data. These observations are compiled by the World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS) and stored in the Fluctuation of Glacier database (FoG) and provide crucial information on annual variability and long-term trends in glacier evolution. Globally, the mass of glaciers was fairly stable during the 1970s and 1980s, with periods of slightly positive and negative balances. Ice loss has been increasing since around 1990 and the rate of loss is accelerating. Glaciers are experiencing increased net mass loss at both higher elevations and at higher latitudes. Estimates based on the FoG database show that the average total change in ice thickness across all observed glaciers from 1976 to 2023 is around -14 m. When accounting for the difference in density between ice and water, this equates to 12 metres of water equivalent (m w.e.) over all the glaciers on the planet. A mass change of -1.0 m w.e. per year is equivalent to an ice thickness loss of about 1.1 m per year and corresponds to a mass loss of one tonne per square metre of glacier surface. The resulting cumulative ice loss accounts for around 8200 gigatonnes (Gt) of water since 1976, of which 8100 Gt has been lost since 1991, and 3600 Gt since 2014. Glaciers have contributed to more than 22 mm of global sea level rise since 1976, with 44% of this contribution during the past decade alone. During this period, glaciers contributed to sea level rise at a rate of about 1 mm per year. In 2023, the ice lost from glaciers globally was equivalent to 1.7 mm of sea level rise. This is about 4.6 times the amount of ice contained in all glaciers in the European Alps [5] . The impact of this global glacier mass loss on sea level is explained in more detail in the ‘ Cryosphere ’ section. Internationally coordinated glacier monitoring began in 1894 [7] . Initially, the focus was on the collection and publication of data on the position of  glacier fronts , complemented with pioneering work on mass balance measurements and accurate mapping at selected glaciers [8] . After the late 1940s, the focus changed to glacier-wide mass balance measurements complemented with accurate surveys of glacier thickness and volume changes, using data from airborne and then space-borne sensors from the 1970s. These observations, compiled by the WGMS [9]  and its predecessor organisations, show that glaciers around the world are in retreat and losing mass [10] . Data on the position of glacier front variations, which started being collected in 1535, show global glacier retreat over the last century. Intermittent periods of glaciers gaining mass and moving forward have generally been limited to a subsample and have not come close to achieving the maximum positions seen during the Little Ice Age period of about 1200–1700 AD. Observations since 1850 show that the rates of mass loss during the early 21st-century are unprecedented on a global scale. This is the case at least for the time period observed and, based on reconstructions from written and illustrated documents, probably also for recorded history [10] . The current strong imbalance in mass implies that glaciers in many regions will very likely suffer further ice loss, even if the climate remains stable. Figure 3. Cumulative regional glacier mass changes (Gt or m w.e.) from 1976 to present for the 19 regions of the Global Terrestrial Network for Glaciers. Specific mass changes in m w.e. indicate the mean height of the water layer lost over a given glacier surface; large negative values indicate regions where glaciers have lost the most mass. The mass-change in Gt of water is obtained through multiplying by the regional glacier area in km 2 . Cumulative glacier mass changes in Gt correspond to the volume of water lost (1 km 3  w.e. = 1 Gt) and are related to the regional contributions to global mean sea-level rise in mm. \n DOWNLOAD DATA Cumulative glacier mass changes, measured in gigatonnes, allow comparison of the net loss in mass of water from the different glaciated regions, which is equivalent to their contribution to sea level rise. Glacier mass changes measured in m w.e., meanwhile, allow comparison of the rates of loss, highlighting regions which are suffering the most. For example, Alaska has lost the largest amounts of ice equivalent in water since 1976, but the Southern Andes has seen a higher rate of loss during the same time period. In line with the global trends, glaciers in the largest glaciated regions of Arctic Canada and Alaska experienced periods of relatively stable cumulative mass changes from the 1970s to the 1990s. Smaller regions like the Alps, New Zealand, Scandinavia and the Caucasus experienced periods of relatively stable to slightly negative mass balances, with short periods of mass gain during the same period. After the 1990s, however, glacier mass loss started to increase, mostly driven by losses in Alaska, but closely followed by strong and continued mass losses in all regions. In 2023, much of Europe continued to experience glacier mass loss. A second consecutive year of exceptional ice loss, equivalent to 4% of the total volume, was seen in the European Alps. Together with the record glacier mass loss year 2022, glaciers in the European Alps have lost 10% of their volume over the last two years [11] . Figure 4. Map showing the locations of the reference and benchmark glaciers used for the calculation of glacier mass balance changes in Europe during 2023, showing glaciers (light blue) and glacier region margins (dashed boxes).

Credit: C3S/ECMWF/WGMS. Reference and benchmark glaciers provide the annual data to calculate the preliminary estimates of global glacier mass loss during the past year [6] . The WGMS  reference glaciers  have more than 30 years of continuous glaciological mass balance measurements. They are selected as their fluctuations are mainly driven by climatic factors and are not subject to other major influences [12]  such as avalanches, calving or surge dynamics, heavy debris cover, artificial snow production or melt protection [13] . In 2023, the WGMS introduced the term ‘benchmark’ for glaciers that have not yet reached 30 years of ongoing glaciological mass balance measurements but are either located in regions without reference glaciers, or where existing reference glaciers are predicted to disappear in the near future. A benchmark glacier has a time series of more than 10 years of ongoing glaciological mass balance measurements, but otherwise fulfils the same preconditions as defined for the reference glaciers. [1] Calculating the contribution of glaciers to sea level change on a global scale is a challenging task. The ‘ Glacier contribution to sea level ’ section of ESOTC 2019 explains this in more detail. The ‘ Cryosphere ’ indicator explains the different components of the cryosphere and their contribution to sea level rise. See also, Cogley et al. (2011).

Credit: Portra Massive volcanic eruptions on the Indian peninsula have long been proposed as an alternative cause for the demise of the dinosaurs. This phase of active volcanism took place in a period just before the Earth was struck by a meteorite, 66 million years ago. The effect of these volcanic eruptions on the Earth’s climate has been topic of fierce scientific debates for decades. Now, climate scientists from Utrecht University and the University of Manchester show that, while the volcanism caused a temporary cold period, the effects had already worn off thousands of years before the meteorite impacted. The scientists therefore conclude that the meteorite impact was the ultimate cause of the dinosaur extinction event. What killed off the dinosaurs—was it the Chicxulub meteorite or did the effects of massive volcanism also play a role? Many modern children’s books on the history of dinosaurs include speculation on these two competing ideas. The meteorite impact in the Gulf of Mexico roughly 66 million years ago is well researched and widely known as the defining end of the dinosaur age. But earth scientists have fiercely debated for decades whether a massive outpouring of lava on the Indian continent, which occurred both prior to and after the meteorite impact, also contributed to the demise of dinosaur populations roaming the Earth. These volcanic eruptions released vast amounts of CO₂, dust, and sulphur, thereby significantly altering the climate on earth—but in different ways and on different timescales to a meteorite impact. Ancient peats A new publication in the prestigious scientific journal  Science Advances  by climate scientists from Utrecht University and the University of Manchester now provides compelling evidence that while the volcanic eruptions in India had a clear impact on global climate, they likely had little to no effect on the mass extinction of the dinosaurs. By analysing fossil molecules in ancient peats from the United States of America, the scientific team reconstructed air temperatures for the time period covering both the volcanic eruptions and the meteorite impact. Using this method, the researchers show that a major volcanic eruption occurred about 30.000 years before the meteor impact, coinciding with at least a 5° Celsius cooling of the climate. They also conclude that this cooling was likely the result of volcanic sulphur emissions blocking sunlight from reaching the Earth’s surface. Importantly, the scientists discovered that by around 20.000 years before the meteorite impact, temperatures on Earth had already stabilised and had climbed back to similar temperatures before the volcanic eruptions started. This period of global warming was likely aided by volcanic CO 2  emissions, says Lauren O’Connor at Utrecht University: “These volcanic eruptions and associated CO 2  and sulphur release would have had drastic consequences for life on earth. But these events happened millennia before the meteorite impact and probably played only a small part in the extinction of dinosaurs.” Impact winter With the effects of volcanism practically ruled out, this would leave the Chicxulub meteorite impact as the primary cause of the dinosaur mass extinction. “By comparison, the impact from the asteroid unleashed a chain of disasters, including wildfires, earthquakes, tsunamis, and an ‘impact winter’ that blocked sunlight and devastated ecosystems. We believe the asteroid that ultimately delivered the fatal blow,” says Rhodri Jerrett at the University of Manchester. The fossil peats that the researchers analysed contain specific membrane-spanning molecules produced by bacteria. The structure of these molecules changes depending on the temperature of their environment. By analysing the composition of these molecules preserved in ancient sediments, scientists are able to calculate past temperatures. O’Connor adds: “This way, we were able to create a detailed ‘temperature timeline’ for the years leading up to the dinosaur extinction, which we can compare to the fossil record to understand the relative timing of events.”. The researchers from Utrecht University, the University of Manchester, Plymouth University, and the Denver Museum of Nature & Science, are now applying the same approach to reconstruct past climate at other critical periods in Earth’s history.

A new study identifies at-risk  ... [+]  states for natural disasters in 2025. The world feels heavy right now after the California wildfires caused so much loss on the heels of Asheville, N.C.’s shocking Hurricane Helene when over 120 residents perished. Survivors of both weather-related disasters are dealing with shock, trauma and a roller coaster of emotions that are shifting by the minute due to  “climate grief.\"  In the past, I have reported on  states where work-life balance lags  and  states where paid leave could be coming soon.  Now, with the incidences of weather-related disasters in this country, a new study reveals the at-risk states for natural disasters in 2025. A new study by  DJC Law  sought to identify the most dangerous U.S. states for natural disasters by analyzing the frequency of wildfires, tornadoes and floods. Data was sourced from governmental reports, including historical records of wildfires, tornado occurrences and flood events to calculate the probability of each disaster type in every state. These probabilities were combined to determine the overall natural disaster risk for each state, with higher probabilities indicating greater vulnerability. Researchers collected data for this study from governmental sources, covering the following metrics for each state: number of wildfires from 2010 to 2022; number of tornadoes from 2008 to 2023 and number of floods from 2010 to 2025. These probabilities were then used to calculate the likelihood of natural disasters occurring in each state in the coming years. The following states are ranked in descending order, with higher chance scores indicating a higher risk of experiencing natural disasters. The ranking reflects the combined likelihood of wildfires, tornadoes and floods based on past occurrences and projected probabilities. You can find details of the study  here . The top 10 at-risk states, along with the chances of a natural disaster, are as follows. 1.  Texas  (23.64% chance). This state has the dubious title as the most dangerous state for natural disasters. It has the highest likelihood of catastrophic events occurring in the future (23.64%). It is the most tornado-prone state in the U.S., recording 1,774 tornado incidents between 2008 and 2023. In 2022, wildfires were the most prevalent natural disaster in Texas, where 12,571 cases were reported. 2.  California  (18.12% chance). The second most natural disaster-prone state is California, where 101,760 wildfires occurred, the highest number recorded by any state between 2010 and 2022. The estimated probability of future natural disasters occurring in California is 18.12%. Similar to Texas, California also faces a 3.65% likelihood of floods in the coming years.

Minnesota  (10.69% chance). Ranking third in terms of vulnerability to weather-related disasters, Minnesota has a 10.69% likelihood of wildfires, tornadoes or floods occurring in the upcoming years. Between 2010 and 2025, Minnesota had one of the highest levels of flood activity, with 11 major floods recorded and a 5.02% probability of future floods. 4.  Mississippi  (10.49% chance). Ranking as the fourth most impacted state by natural disasters, Mississippi has a 10.49% probability of weather-related catastrophes occurring in the future. In 2022, the state recorded the highest number of tornadoes, with 184 cases. The likelihood of Mississippi facing tornadoes in the coming years is 7.18%. 5.  North Carolina  (10.31% chance). Coming in fifth is North Carolina, where people are most likely to experience a natural disaster. It’s the third most wildfire-prone state, after Texas and California, with 51,277 wildfires reported over a 13-year period. Plus, a total of 573 tornadoes occurred in North Carolina between 2008 and 2023, contributing to its position in the ranking. 6.  Louisiana  (10.27% chance) The sixth-ranking state is Louisiana, which has the highest risk of natural disasters. It has the probability of 4.39% for tornadoes and 4.11% for floods in the future. Over a 16-year period, the state was hit by 924 tornadoes, plus nine major floods between 2010 and 2025. 7.  Missouri  (10.05% chance). The seventh high-risk state for weather-related disasters is Missouri, which has 937 tornadoes recorded over a 16-year period. The year 2017 saw the highest levels of natural disasters in the state, with 3,398 wildfires and 102 tornadoes recorded. 8.  Georgia  (9.79% chance). The eighth state most likely to experience a natural disaster in the future is Georgia, which has a 9.79% probability. Similar to California, wildfires are the most common natural disasters in the state. In 2022 alone, Georgia recorded 3,621 wildfire cases and had a 5.82% chance of future wildfire events. 9.  North Dakota  (9.16% chance). The ninth state with the highest vulnerability to natural disasters is North Dakota, which had 13 recorded floods between 2010 and 2025. The state has the highest probability of experiencing flood events in the coming years at 5.94%. Tornadoes are the second most common natural disaster in the state. 10.  Alabama  (9.14% chance). Completing the list, Alabama has a 9.14% probability of experiencing weather-related events in the upcoming years. Like Louisiana and Mississippi, tornadoes are the most frequent natural disaster in Alabama, with 1,263 recorded cases over a 16-year period. I spoke with Dan Christensen, CEO at  DJC Law , about the study. “Natural disaster vulnerability patterns across the United States show concerning trends,” he told me. “Risk factors are compounding in certain regions, with Texas exemplifying how multiple disaster types create a cumulative risk of 23.64%. This significantly impacts emergency preparedness, insurance markets and public policy.” Christensen believes we’re witnessing unprecedented natural disaster frequency and intensity. And he argues that California’s record of over 100,000 wildfire incidents in just over a decade signals the need for restructured response frameworks. He adds that Minnesota’s 5.02% future flood probability shows that traditionally safer regions face new challenges. \"Policymakers and residents must prioritize robust disaster preparedness infrastructure, especially in states where multiple disaster types intersect,\" he insists. Christensen summarized the findings by pointing out that states like Texas, California and Minnesota are particularly vulnerable to natural disasters and cautions that residents must remain vigilant. He notes that recent events, such as the California wildfires demonstrate how natural disasters can strike unexpectedly, causing significant destruction. “Being proactive in disaster preparedness can significantly reduce the damage caused and help communities recover more quickly,” he emphasizes. Christensen suggests that it’s essential that those who live in at-risk states for natural disasters have this knowledge. It can help them to prepare or, if necessary, take the steps to protect their lives and property in case of such events. One Community. Many Voices.

It’s going to be an emotional trip,\" the  disaster spiritual care volunteer for the American Red Cross  said. Miller is embarking on a trip where he's helping people who lost their homes, belongings, and loved ones  find hope in the wake of the California wildfires. \"They need someone there to comfort them encourage them realize there's tomorrow,\" Miller said.  The Mainer is one of 20 volunteers in the Northern New England region who deployed to Los Angeles to provide disaster relief to those who have been impacted.  \"First, we try to make sure they have food, make sure they have lodging, make sure all their needs are met,\" Miller explained. \"Do they need a prescription? Maybe their prescription got all burnt up. So, I send them to a nurse a nurse starts making phone calls a doctor then calls a pharmacy. Whatever they need, we get for them.\"   RELATED:  Coastal communities brace for uncertain future as worse storms are likely ahead This is Miller's second time in just three months helping people impacted by a natural disaster. The first was Hurricane Helene.  “The last time when I was leaving for North Carolina, I hadn't even left this airport, and they were asking if I could stay for another two weeks,\" he recalled.  Caroline King is the executive director at the  American Red Cross of Northern and Eastern Maine . King said there's an increased need for volunteers due to natural disasters happening more frequently. \"There are more and more billion-dollar-a-year disasters then we've ever seen,\" King said. \"In order to be able to respond, we need those volunteers.\"  RELATED:  Maine businesses support California animal shelter in wake of wildfires According to the  National Centers for Environmental Information , there were 27 confirmed weather or climate disaster events in 2024 with damages totaling over $1 billion.  \"We are now in a state of continuous response,” King said. “Every day we are responding to larger bigger disasters.”  Climate change is causing climatologists like Sean Birkel to increasingly focus on extreme weather events. \"With the current trends and the climate model projections we have available, it shows that we should expect to see more intense storms and more heavy rainfall events,” Birkel said.  The state's climatologist  said adaptation is key in addressing the impacts of climate change.  RELATED:  Los Angeles wildfires: How you can help displaced families and first responders \"I think it’s really important so that we adapt and that we build more resilient communities, so that when more intense storms occur, we are better prepared,” Birkel said.  As communities across the country continue to grapple with the aftermath of natural disasters, volunteers like Miller are grateful they can give a little light to people during hard times.  \"That's what we're all about: helping people,\" Miller shared.   If you would like to support communities impacted by natural disasters,  click  here .  These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems.

Email: g.carbonaro@newsweek.com.  Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources. More frequent and more destructive natural disasters are shaking the foundation of the U.S. homeowners insurance systems, with coverage becoming more costly and harder to procure for millions of Americans. In vulnerable states like California and Florida, where insurers face higher costs and catastrophe exposure, many companies have drastically cut coverage over the past few years, fearing they might not be able to pay the enormous claims generally linked to extreme events. The solution to the struggle faced by these states might have to be a radical one, according to some experts, such as centralizing the insurance system at the federal level—even if it's likely so unpopular that it would take a cross-states disaster to make it palatable. Since 1980, the U.S. has been hit by 403 weather and climate-related disasters, according to data from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI),causing an estimated total of more than $2.917 trillion in damages and 16,918 deaths. Each of the past four decades saw the number of extreme events increasing: in the 1980s, there were a total of 33 natural disasters causing an overall $219.6 billion in damages; in the 1990s, there were 57, costing $335.3 billion; the 2000s reported 67 natural disasters, for a total cost of $621.3 billion; and in the 2010s, there were 131 extreme events costing a total of $994.6 billion. The frequency and severity of natural disasters is accelerating fast. In the last five years alone, the country was struck by 115 catastrophic events that caused total damage of $745.7 billion. In disaster-prone states like California and Florida, pricing risk accurately and reflecting the risk with higher premiums has already become a problem for insurers. Some experts fear that, unless important reform is implemented, high-risk areas of these states might eventually become uninsurable. One radical solution to the U.S. insurance crisis could be to have a federal insurance system aggregating risk at the national level instead of having state insurance regulators, Steven Haynes, assistant professor of Practice, Finance and Managerial Economics at the University of Texas at Dallas, told  Newsweek . \"What we really need to do is, instead of aggregating [risk] at a local level, we need to act at a federal level, and that way, people who live in North Dakota are sharing losses in California,\" he said. The idea is to spread the risk geographically across the entire country, instead of it being focused on the most at-risk areas. \"People don't like that idea,\" Haynes added. \"It's an anti-American idea because it's more of a social thought. But it is something that realistically has to be considered because more and more people are left with nothing, because roughly 60 percent of people who have a mortgage paid off don't have homeowners insurance. It's an astronomical number.\" And these people, should they be struck by a natural disaster, would stand to lose everything, Haynes said. \"That's not acceptable. It's just not feasible,\" he added. Nancy Wallace, a professor of finance and real estate at UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business, told  Newsweek  that insurance regulators at the moment have an incentive to compete with other states by keeping their rates as low as possible. That system has not served California well, she said. \"There's empirical evidence that California rates are lower than many other states, including, of all places, Oklahoma. And that in fact, states around us are subsidizing the cost of risk-carrying in California,\" Wallace added. \"That problem would potentially be mitigated by a national system. But land in the U.S. is regulated locally. And so it's sort of natural that some of these regulations are more state level or local; breaking through that is going to be a challenge.\" \"It would literally rock the entire [insurance] world overnight, so I don't see them doing it,\" Haynes said. \"Insurers would love it because there would be less complexity, but lawyers would not be so happy about suddenly losing business. You don't need as many attorneys if you're using the federal courts for all these types of cases. And insurance law is a big part of the caseloads in most states.\" What he thinks it more likely to happen, realistically, is that traditional risk exposure would remain at the state level while at the national level a federal cap policy might be introduced. \"You would have companies who are providing insurance for hurricane, wildfire risk, severe convective storms, and hail risk all across the country, and everyone would be paying their premium based on an underwriting category that they fall into,\" Haynes said. Charles Nyce, department chair and a Dr. William T. Hold associate professor of risk management and insurance at Florida State University, told  Newsweek  that a national system could work, but only if it covers the highest levels of risk in disasters. \"For example, the federal insurance system does not kick in until the losses from the event are greater than $5 billion or $10 billion, in other words only for events that are truly catastrophic,\" he explained. Nyce has done research that theoretically shows that government intervention in insurance markets is best done at the high loss levels. \"Private insurance works best at lower loss levels, where underwriting and risk-based premium setting are important. Government intervention works best when the access to cheaper capital is more important,\" Nyce said, using an example where the losses are so bad that underwriting didn't really matter. \"At that point, government access to cheaper capital—cheaper than a private insurer's capital access—is more important,\" he added. Prior federal attempts at providing coverage \"have struggled to balance their goal of increasing availability and reducing premiums against the need to base underwriting and pricing on actuarially sound principles to ensure sufficient reserves for paying claims,\" Mark Friedlander, director of corporate communications at the Insurance Information Institute, or Triple-I, told  Newsweek . The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), established by  Congress  in 1968 and managed by FEMA, is a good case in point, Friedlander said. The NFIP has two main policy goals, according to a recent document by the Congressional Research Service: \"to provide access to primary flood insurance, thereby allowing for the transfer of some of the financial risk of property owners to the federal government\" and \"to mitigate and reduce the nation's comprehensive flood risk through the development and implementation of floodplain management standards.\" The program counts 4.7 million policies across more than 22,000 communities in 56 states and jurisdictions across the country and provides more than $1.3 trillion in coverage while making $4.3 billion in annual premium revenue. But as floods are the most common natural disasters in the U.S., the program has been facing rising costs in recent years. \"Created in 1968 to protect property owners for a peril that most private insurers were reluctant to cover at that time, NFIP's 'one-size-fits-all' approach to underwriting and pricing has led to the program now owing more than $20 billion to the U.S. Treasury because it lacked the reserves to fully pay claims after major events like Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy,\" Friedlander said. \"It also often led to lower-risk property owners unfairly subsidizing coverage for higher-risk properties. However, NFIP's Risk Rating 2.0, implemented in 2022, is actuarially pricing risk similar to how private flood insurers price risk.\" A national system would help \"soften the blow\" to states that are exposed to extreme events like floods, wildfires, earthquakes, severe convective storms and hurricanes, according to Nyce. One risk in this system, Nyce warned, is that it could be seen as subsidizing high-risk areas by charging lower premiums there and higher premiums to low-risk zones. \"That is where it becomes a big political issue,\" he said. \"Premiums would still have to be risk-based for it to make sense with the most prone areas funding more of the losses. \"I do not think the current political landscape lends itself to the federal government expanding its insurance market participation.\" Haynes said that in order for such a system to work, you shouldn't have people in Florida paying the same rates as someone in Wyoming who's facing lower risk. \"So there would still be this process,\" he said. \"But from a pooling perspective, it ensures that you don't have all the high risk in one categorical pool or one funding pool. And that's really what risk pooling was meant to do.\" David T. Russell, professor of insurance and finance at California State University, told  Newsweek  that it remains to be seen \"whether or not taxpayers would support a catastrophe program for perils such as wildfire, hurricane and earthquake, especially if it means that some taxpayers would subsidize others over and over through underpricing.\" Private reinsurance markets work relatively well for these perils, Russell said, and a federal program is not needed for most of them at the moment. \"This is especially difficult when politics at the federal level oppose support for blue states such as California which may be a perceived beneficiary,\" he added. Friedlander added: \"In the current Congress, it is highly doubtful a proposal for a national property insurance program would gain any traction.\" If a national system is ever introduced, Haynes said, it will be after the country is struck by a cross-state natural disaster. \"It's probably going to be a hurricane, because it's going to have to transcend boundaries,\" he said. \"And honestly, it's going to be Florida or Texas.\" Newsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair We value your input and encourage you to rate this article.

The storm moved through the Deer Lodge and Sunbright areas around 8:30 p.m., taking the lives of a mother and daughter from the same household. Morgan County Emergency Management Agency confirmed  the two fatalities and three additional injured people in a Facebook post on Friday morning. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of those affected by this tragic event,\" the Morgan County Emergency Management Agency post said. At around 8:27 p.m. on Thursday, Feb. 6, a tornado touched down in the Deer Lodge and Sunbright areas of Morgan County. The storm resulted in severe property damage, injuries and loss of life, according to Morgan County Emergency Management Agency. This was the first confirmed February tornado in Morgan County on record,  according to the National Weather Service. When is tornado season in Tennessee? Morgan County may have seen first of 2025 The Tennessee Highway Patrol deployed a team of 30 state troopers to the scene on Thursday evening. State troopers continue to be on the scene on Friday morning to escort the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency and National Weather Service personnel to assess the storm's damage, according to Captain Stacey Heatherly. \"We will continue to be there and we will not leave until our job is done,\" Heatherly said in a  Tennessee Highway Patrol update video. On the evening of Thursday, Feb 6, there was another tornado in Grainger County. The storm damaged multiple buildings in Thorne Hill, Tenn., about 100 miles east of Sunbright. There were no injuries or fatalities, according to Jeffrey Atkins, director of Grainger County Emergency Management. The majority of the damage was concentrated near the intersection of U.S. 25 East and Mountain Valley Highway 131, according to the National Weather Service. In addition to the damaged buildings, there were fallen trees and customers without power on Friday morning, Feb. 7. The Thorn Hill tornado was also only the fourth confirmed tornado in Grainger County for any part of the year,  according to the National Weather Service. The National Weather Service confirmed both tornados in Morgan County and Grainger County as an EF-2 and an EF-1 respectively. The tornado in Morgan County saw maximum sustained winds of 135 miles per hour while the second storm in Grainger County saw maximum sustained winds of 110 miles per hour, according to the National Weather Service. Sunbright, Tennessee is located in Morgan County. The small city  has a population of less than 600 people  and is located about 60 miles Northwest of Knoxville Sunbright and Deer Lodge, the other affected area, are neighboring communities. They are only about seven miles apart. Less than one year ago, the Sunbright community was hit by a tornado that caused extensive damage. There were no deaths in the 2024 storm,  according to previous Knox News reporting. The storm occurred on the evening of April 2, 2024. Multiple buildings were damaged, including a funeral home, a local Methodist church, some vacant buildings and residential buildings, according to Sunbright Mayor Karen Melton. Following the fatal storm, the National Weather Service is looking for reports of storm damage in Morgan County. If you see hail, flooding or other storm damage reach out to the National Weather Service via their phone number or social media pages. A tornado watch indicates that the weather conditions are right for a tornado to pop up in an area, according to the National Weather Service. It is a signal that you should be prepared if a tornado does arise. A tornado warning means that a tornado has been sighted or indicated by weather radar. It is a warning that you are in possible danger and should get to a safe spot, like a basement or interior room with no windows.", "metadata": {"published_date": "Unknown", "author": "Unknown", "source": "Knoxville News Sentinel"}}

The costs of both manmade and natural disasters continue to rise on an annual basis in the United States and around the globe. The  Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA) and state and local communities need access to new technologies and innovations that reduce risk, improve protective measures, and optimize mitigation investments and lower damage, disruption, and costs related to disaster recovery. New mechanisms for alerting the public about wildfire and other events will better protect our citizens and communities from active hazards, route commodity deliveries around incidents, and further protect critical infrastructure. As a result of enhanced alerting solutions, local first responders will have improved access to incident information and can plan rapidly and better allocate limited resources. The  Science and Technology Directorate’s  (S&T’s) Next Generation Disaster Proofing research and development will pursue new technologies and standards to streamline FEMA disaster resilience investments in insurance, mitigation, and recovery operations. It also will develop and simplify assistance programs that enable the states, local communities, and the private sector to help disaster survivors recover more efficiently and effectively. Other examples of targeted research and development outcomes will be to develop new approaches to optimizing resilience investments to reduce disaster risk and losses, to measure community resilience and monitor program effectiveness.

In the following days, NASA teams provided data and imagery to help on-the-ground responders understand the disaster’s impacts and deploy aid. Building on this response and similar successes, on June 13, NASA announced a new system to support disaster response organizations in the U.S. and around the world. “When disasters strike, NASA is here to help — at home and around the world,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. “As challenges from extreme weather grow, so too does the value of NASA’s efforts to provide critical Earth observing data to disaster-response teams on the frontlines. We’ve done so for years. Now, through this system, we expand our capability to help power our U.S. government partners, international partners, and relief organizations across the globe as they take on disasters — and save lives.” The team behind NASA’s Disaster Response Coordination System gathers science, technology, data, and expertise from across the agency and provides it to emergency managers. The new system will be able to provide up-to-date information on fires, earthquakes, landslides, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, and other extreme events. “The risk from climate-related hazards is increasing, making more people vulnerable to extreme events,” said Karen St. Germain, director of NASA’s Earth Science Division. “This is particularly true for the 10% of the global population living in low-lying coastal regions who are vulnerable to storm surges, waves and tsunamis, and rapid erosion. NASA’s disaster system is designed to deliver trusted, actionable Earth science in ways and means that can be used immediately, to enable effective response to disasters and ultimately help save lives.” Agencies working with NASA include the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Geological Survey, and the U.S. Agency for International Development — as well as international organizations such as World Central Kitchen. “With this deliberate and structured approach, we can be even more effective in putting Earth science into action,” said Josh Barnes, at  NASA’s Langley Research Center  in Hampton, Virginia. Barnes manages the Disaster Response Coordination System. When the floods and landslides ravaged parts of Brazil in May, officials from the U.S. Southern Command — working with the U.S. Space Force and Air Force, and regional partners — reached out to NASA for Earth-observing data. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tBefore and After\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\tSpring 2024\t\t\t\t\t Image 1 (JPG) ### KB PNG (3 MB) Image 2 (JPG) ### KB PNG (3 MB) NASA’s response included maps of potential power outages from the Black Marble project at  NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center  in Greenbelt, Maryland. Disaster response coordinators at NASA Goddard also reviewed high-resolution optical data — from the  Commercial Smallsat Data Acquisition Program  — to map more than  4,000 landslides . Response coordinators from  NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory  and the California Institute of Technology, both in Southern California, produced  flood extent maps  using data from the NASA and U.S. Geological Survey Landsat mission and from ESA’s (the European Space Agency) Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite. Response coordinators at  NASA’s Johnson Space Center  in Houston also provided  photographs of the flooding  taken by astronauts aboard the International Space Station. The Brazil event is just one of hundreds of responses NASA has supported over the past decade. The team aids decision-making for a wide range of natural hazards and disasters, from  hurricanes  and  earthquakes  to  tsunamis  and  oil spills .  “NASA’s Disasters Program advances science for disaster resilience and develops accessible resources to help communities around the world make informed decisions for disaster planning,” said Shanna McClain, manager of NASA’s Disasters Program. “The new Disaster Response Coordination System significantly expands our efforts to bring the power of Earth science when responding to disasters.” For more information visit: https://disasters.nasa.gov/response By  Jacob Reed NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center , Greenbelt, Md.

The multi-day event allows local and military emergency responders to coordinate, deploy, and mitigate dangerous scenarios in the days after a catastrophic disaster.  Facilitated by Task Force 46 (Michigan National Guard) in cooperation with the Missouri National Guard, the drills involve reconnaissance, urban search and rescue, mass casualty decontamination, and structural and infrastructure damage assessment in the vicinity of Busch Stadium and the Missouri River between Grafton and St. Charles.  The exercises will be visible in downtown St. Louis, but the public is asked not to visit the drill area. Residents should avoid the 8th Street side of Busch Stadium, as 8th Street at Clark Street will be closed to traffic during daylight hours.  Motorists on Interstate 64/40 approaching Busch Stadium should also be asked to take care and avoid distracted driving while driving by military exercises and equipment. There will also be military vehicle traffic on Highway 55 early in the morning on July 15.  The drill scenario involves an 8.4 magnitude earthquake along the New Madrid Seismic Fault. The three-day exercise will simulate a focused response to structural damage, civilian casualties, and chemical contamination in the vicinity of Busch Stadium during a baseball game. Another focus area for the exercise includes Multi-Role Bridge river crossings of the Missouri River due to notionally damaged bridges.  The drills will involve approximately 500 individuals, including local emergency responders, military responders, hospitals, and volunteers. The exercise will use military helicopters and vehicles, damaged vehicles and debris, and multiple staging areas, in the vicinity of Busch Stadium.  Based out of Lansing, Michigan, Task Force 46 is a National Guard element that is deployed to provide command and support of military response forces in support of civilian responders to manage catastrophic chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear incidents. This is the first time the St. Louis area has been chosen to host the full-scale, multi-domain exercises. Last year, Task Force 46 conducted similar exercises in Nashville.  The exercises are being coordinated with STARRS, the St. Louis Area Regional Response System, which is housed within East-West Gateway Council of Governments. STARRS coordinates with emergency responders across local jurisdictions to enhance the region’s capabilities to prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from natural disasters, terrorism and large-scale industrial accidents and hazards.   \n  \nMembers of the National Guard discuss operations during setup of the Dense Urban Terrain exercise.\n \nYour feedback was  not sent .\n \n \n \n \nI was looking for:\n \n(required)\n \n \n \n \n \n Why? \n \n \nComments are helpful!\n \n \n \n \n500 character limit\n \n \n \n \nYou should be redirected in a few seconds.

Near San Pedro Sula, Honduras, active faults remain unpredictable increasing the risk of unexpected disasters.  \n \nSentinel Watch focused on an earthquake scenario that caused a tsunami, which was based on information from a previous regional disaster. This allowed participants to work through realistic, simulated injects to propose the best-integrated response with their resources.  \n \nThe first day was on information sharing to provide a common understanding of each organization’s capabilities and background for the next day’s events.  \n \nIf requested by the host nation during a natural disaster, JTF-Bravo can provide its unique capabilities, which is a short notice deployment by the U.S. Southern Command's Situational Assessment Team. This team is comprised of a variety of JTF-Bravo personnel from J-Staff, 612th Air Base Squadron, Army Forces Battalion, and 1-228th Aviation Regiment that can be tailored to provide U.S. foreign disaster assistance led by USAID’s BHA.  \n \nOn the second day, participants from Honduras and the U.S. worked through on how they would response together and provided inputs for the best course of action to quickly save lives and provide aid to the people of Honduras during an earthquake and tsunami emergency.  \n \nConcluding the event, each participant received a completion certificate for their time, insight and efforts during the exercise from JTF-Bravo’s J9, Civil Military Affairs Director, U.S. Army Lt. Col. Achim Biller.  \n \n“I hope that through this exercise we have contributed our grain of sand to a more prepared and resilient region with freedom, peace and friendship,” said Biller in his closing remarks.  \n \nThe facility Sentinel Watch was held at was donated by the U.S. in 2015, through USSOUTHCOM. USSOUTHCOM remains true to its enduring promise to the CENTAM region and continues to provide support and services with JTF-Bravo. \n \nThis partnership and collaborative training emphasizes Honduras and the U.S.’s collective interest in saving lives and helping the community.  \n \nJTF-Bravo prepares for the next two iterations of Sentinel Watch in the upcoming months with Belize and Guatemala.

For example, hurricanes may damage our offshore production facilities or coastal refining and petrochemical plants in vulnerable areas. Our facilities are designed, engineered, constructed, and operated to withstand a variety of extreme climatic and other conditions, with safety factors built in to cover a number of uncertainties, including those associated with wave, wind, and current intensity, marine ice flow patterns, permafrost stability, storm surge magnitude, temperature extremes, extreme rainfall events, and earthquakes.  Our consideration of changing weather conditions and inclusion of safety factors in design covers the engineering uncertainties that climate change and other events may potentially introduce. Our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events depends in part upon the effectiveness of our robust facility engineering, our rigorous disaster preparedness and response, and business continuity planning. Strategic emergency support groups are established around the world to develop and practice emergency response strategies and assist field responders. Detailed, well-practiced, and continuously improved emergency response plans are tailored to each facility to help us prepare for unplanned events, including extreme weather. Periodic emergency drills are conducted with appropriate government agencies and community coalitions to help heighten readiness and minimize the impacts of an event.

In this episode, Kate Wheelock, Chief of NOAA’s Disaster Preparedness Program, explains how her team facilitates internal communication, coordination, and preparation for all types of unforeseen disasters. In April 2019, the United States Coast Guard Sector Mobile held their annual Continuity of Operations exercise at the NOAA Gulf of Mexico Disaster Response Center (DRC) in Mobile, Alabama. Each year, Sector Mobile simulates a disaster to test evacuating their normal facility, relocate, and resume mission operations. The exercise is designed to ensure the outlined processes and procedures work seamlessly as well as ensures the IT connectivity works across agencies. Participants were briefed about a hypothetical incoming hurricane. Then, a team of approximately 50 Coast Guard members activated and relocated to the DRC. The four-hour exercise tested pre-developed plans and agreements for both the Coast Guard and NOAA. Listen to our latest  podcast HOST : This is the NOAA Ocean Podcast. I’m Abby Reid. Benjamin Franklin once said, “By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.” And William Shakespeare wrote in Henry V, “All things are ready, if our mind be so.” Whether you’re studying for a test, changing the oil in your car, or putting a warm jacket on in freezing weather, preparing for the future is a smart thing to do. The National Ocean Service’s Disaster Preparedness Program does just that, but on a much larger scale. Founded in 2017, the Program expands on the activity of the Gulf of Mexico Disaster Response Center, and coordinates operational capabilities and knowledge from across the National Ocean Service and NOAA to ensure that commerce, communities, and natural resources can recover as quickly as possible from natural, and non-natural, disasters. I sat down with Kate Wheelock, Chief of the Disaster Preparedness Program, to find out more. Destruction in Key West, Florida, following Hurricane Irma in September 2017. (Credit: U.S. Coast Guard) KATE WHEELOCK : My name is Kate Wheelock. I’m the chief of the Disaster Preparedness Program in the National Ocean Service of NOAA. And within the National Ocean Service specifically, the Disaster Preparedness Program is in the Office of Response and Restoration. Our program focuses on helping NOAA and our partners effectively respond to and recover from all types of hazards, including coastal disasters. One of the Disaster Preparedness Program mandates is to ensure that the business of NOAA can continue with as little impact as possible under any condition. So that could be a building fire, an electrical outage, cyber attack, an IT systems problem, or a you know a server gets flooded. Now we don’t have you know some of the main systems that we need to be able to collect data or keep it moving. We have to have a plan for that. The National Ocean Service supports economies and ecosystems and communities along the coast, and uh to do that we need to have staff in beautiful places but also really precarious places. We want to make sure that we’re looking after them. And we do that. We do all these things through preparedness planning, through training, through scenario-based exercises, and through incident coordination. HOST : The work of the Disaster Preparedness Program sounded really important internally for NOAA. But why might the public be interested in it? I asked Kate. KATE WHEELOCK : It really enables us to be able to fulfill those really important missions that support coastal economies and coastal communities and trust resources. You know, our ability to do that depends on our ability to react effectively and safely, and in a timely manner, when disasters happen. One success story came out of the 2017 hurricane season. The 2017 hurricane season was one that came quickly and in rapid succession, right? Folks will recall Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Irma, and then Hurricane Maria. They happened one after another, just in rapid succession. So that required- not only was it injury upon injury or insult to insult to local communities and the economy and those kinds of things, but internally for our responders, it was a very busy and somewhat emotionally taxing and physically taxing hurricane season. In the National Ocean Service, we have a  group of people who fly over disaster areas in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. HOST : The group Kate is referencing is the National Ocean Service’s Remote Sensing Division, located within the National Geodetic Survey. KATE WHEELOCK : And their objective is to take high resolution photographic imagery of the area. It allows for them to go, for the public to go who may have evacuated to see if their house is still standing, but it also allows for responders to make those really critical operational decisions that they need to make about what areas they’re going to focus on. You know, is there debris on the runways? Are there boats in shipping channels? After Hurricane Maria in particular, there was a need for doing this kind of survey in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. But that presented a lot of logistical issues for our airplanes and aircraft and crew that were coming from the continental United States. So in order to maximize the flight lines they wanted to fly, flying from Florida out to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands was one, going to burn some flight time and fuel. There were no air strips to land on in Puerto Rico at that time, so then they would’ve had to return back. This was presenting a problem in terms of being able to provide that fast, efficient, and safe response. So we were having coordinating calls. This issue came up, that they were having trouble finding a place to fuel, to even find fuel, and an airstrip to use. And one of our other responding units said, ‘Hey, I know someone in Curaçao through federal kind of an interagency contact, let me call over there, see if their air strip is in good condition and if we can use it. Communicating across the operational units and the response units allowed for this ability for them to collect that imagery much more quickly, much more effectively, cost-effectively as well, and safely. By flying the lines, going over to Curaçao, landing on the airstrip, uploading the data, refuelling, going back and continuing. HOST : During quieter times when there aren’t major hurricanes or other disasters at play, Kate said that exercises and training are cornerstone services provided by the program. KATE WHEELOCK : Our big thing is  if we don’t practice we’re gonna get rusty. And we don’t want that to happen.  So we really want to be ready for anything. Last summer, our team went out to Hawaii and conducted a hurricane scenario exercise with our NOAA staff in Hawaii, and just weeks later Hawaii was confronted with hurricanes Lane, and then Hurricane Olivia. Hawaii being in a remote area and six hours behind you know headquarters in Washington, D.C., you know, so in a sense they’re left to manage these storms on their own in the short-term at least. And having done the exercise just before these storms arrive they will attest themselves that it provided them with the confidence, the knowledge of process, and really strong communication across the staff from all over NOAA, and they were really able to provide back to headquarters really detailed situational awareness so that we knew how we could support them out in the region. So aside from exercises we also support training like Science of Oil Spills, Science of Chemical Releases, Science of Coastal Hazards. Notice I keep saying “science.” We’re a science agency, right? So while we are emergency responders we’re usually out there providing that scientific data, and scientific decision support. HOST : All of these exercises and training, of course, prepare NOAA for the next big event. I asked Kate to describe what typically happens in the lead up to a major storm or other natural disaster. KATE WHEELOCK : When a storm is coming, or any other what I call a “telegraphed event,” right, we can see something might be coming — because we don’t always have that luxury, if it's a tsunami or a tornado or something like that. But for a telegraphed event, we’re getting information from our NOAA colleagues in the Weather Service. We’re monitoring that event, we’re monitoring our staff who may be in an impacted area, and making sure they’re making contact back to their direct supervisors and letting us know what their situation is. We’re collecting information on who’s prepositioning in terms of being ready to go into the area to respond, and what kind of assets we have that are available for that response. If we have a clear indication that there are going to be coastal impacts, then we activate our Incident Management Team. The Incident Management Team coordinates and provides situational awareness during a pending - so even if we’ve got something kind of looking, coming along, and ongoing incidences. HOST : Then I asked Kate how someone interested in Disaster Preparedness could pursue it as a career. KATE WHEELOCK : What we are seeing among kind of the new generation of graduates is an interest in emergency management. And people are studying emergency management. Working with FEMA to get a you know cert to become a certified emergency manager is another route that we’re seeing people, people go. FEMA is the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

The mission will take place from Aug. 19-31.   In Quang Ngai, the PP24-2 and PA24-3 programs will bring together approximately 200 participants, including personnel from the Australian Defense Force, British Armed Forces, Chile, Japan, and members of the U.S. Armed Forces. The U.S. Consul General in Ho Chi Minh City will attend the opening ceremony on Aug. 20.  “During this year’s Pacific Partnership and Pacific Angel mission, we highlight the enduring friendship that drives the U.S.-Vietnam relationship forward in disaster response, medicine, and education. This progress is even more meaningful when we consider how our two countries have overcome our shared past to build a brighter future for the next generation,” said U.S. Consul General Susan Burns. The Pacific Partnership and Pacific Angel humanitarian mission includes a range of activities aimed at enhancing disaster response capabilities, providing humanitarian assistance, and fostering mutual understanding between partnering nations. Medical professionals will conduct exchanges and training sessions at various hospitals and medical centers in Quang Ngai, covering topics such as mass casualty incidents, surgeries, public health, and infectious diseases. In addition, U.S. and Vietnamese officials will hold discussions on forest fire prevention, coastal erosion, and natural disaster management, accompanied by a site survey of the Nghia An anti-erosion embankment.  “Our leaders understand the importance of collaboration, with experts both inside and outside of government, to strengthen and enhance the resilience of vulnerable communities, particularly through disaster preparedness initiatives,” said U.S. Navy Capt. Daniel Keeler, PP24-2 mission commander. “We aim to strengthen coordination on regional and global issues of shared concern and interest, contributing to collective efforts to uphold peace, stability, cooperation, and development both in the region and worldwide.”  Construction efforts will also play a significant role in the mission, with repairs and renovations planned at several local facilities, including Tinh Minh Kindergarten, Nghia Lo Medical Station, Tinh Khe Elementary School, and Tinh Khe Medical Station. These projects are designed to improve the infrastructure and resilience of local community sites. The mission will also emphasize community engagement through a series of English language and music exchanges with students at local schools, fostering cultural interactions and mutual understanding.  “We are dedicated to working with each host nation and our sister branches to enhance capacity, interoperability, combined readiness, and partnership in the Indo-Pacific,” said U.S. Air Force Maj. Bradley Emmett, PA24-3 mission commander. “The relationships built and sustained with our partners through these missions, civil-military operations, and military exchanges help preserve peace and stability in the region. We look forward to working with them in the upcoming week.”  The PP24-2 and PA24-3 mission represents a milestone in foreign affairs engagement with Quang Ngai province, reinforcing the U.S.-Vietnam bilateral relationship nearly a year after the two countries upgraded to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. The program underscores the province’s commitment to global partnerships and disaster preparedness.  For information on Pacific Partnership and Pacific Angel visit:  www.clwp.navy.mil/Pacific-Partnership  and  https://www.pacaf.af.mil   Subject specific information for the media Events or announcements of note for the media Official Navy statements Given by Navy leadership HASC, SASC and Congressional testimony Google Translation Disclaimer Chief of Information Attn: US Navy 1200 Navy Pentagon Washington DC 20350-1200", "metadata": {"published_date": "Unknown", "author": "Unknown", "source": "United States Navy"}}

The medical staff was caring for patients\n                  in 256 beds when the unthinkable happened. The 7.6-magnitude Kashmir earthquake struck on a Saturday morning, eventually killing\n                  86,000 people in the region, displaced 3.5 million others and reduced thousands of\n                  buildings and homes to rubble. It was Pakistan’s most destructive and costliest natural\n                  disaster. But many of those deaths could have been prevented, Mehmood believes, had the country\n                  been better prepared for catastrophe on such a scale. The event made such an impact\n                  on Mehmood that she decided to change careers, and today is associate professor at\n                  the University of South Florida, where she heads the  global disaster management, humanitarian relief and homeland security concentration  in the  College of Public Health  (COPH). “I’m a surgeon by training, but one of things I learned is that a lot of the things\n                  I saw in the operating and emergency rooms can be prevented − but they weren’t being\n                  prevented,’’ she said. “So that’s what drew me toward public health.’’ Mehmood, teaches COPH courses on disaster management, community-based disaster preparedness\n                  and resilience, and is also a technical consultant on emergency and trauma care with\n                  the World Bank in Washington, D.C. She recently traveled to Italy to study and share\n                  information about how its government managed the fallout from two destructive earthquakes,\n                  and also  shared her expertise  on disaster management with the American University of Beirut in Lebanon. Such knowledge is needed more than ever, she said, as natural and man-made catastrophes\n                  are on the rise. “Unfortunately, disasters are becoming more frequent and more intense, from wildfires\n                  to hurricanes,’’ she said. “What we are heading toward is this uncharted territory\n                  of anticipation and preparedness.’’ In Italy, Mehmood joined a group of interdisciplinary researchers to study the stages\n                  of preparedness, response and recovery from the L'Aquila and Amatrice earthquakes.\n                  Her work focused not only on the physical and cultural elements of rebuilding, but\n                  how people cope after a tragic event. “Many survivors reported PTSD, trauma of displacement, feelings of abandonment, and\n                  continuing economic struggles despite government and community efforts,’’ she said.\n                  “Both disasters highlighted the need for robust preparedness measures, including building\n                  codes, early warning systems, public awareness and psychosocial support programs.’’ Mehmood emphasizes building a “systems approach’’ to disaster recovery planning. This\n                  involves a combination of physical and social processes that includes people, organizations,\n                  structures, and environmental factors, each with its own connections and interactions.   The Red Zone of Italian town Amatrice which was destroyed in Central Italy Earthquake\n                     (6.2 Richter scale) on August 24, 2016.

Effective response and recovery is only possible when\n                  we account for these interactions.’’ If we want to mitigate known hazards and prepare for lesser-known hazards, she added,\n                  “we’ll need to move towards a systems approach and enhance the entire system’s adaptive\n                  capacity, which includes our communities and vulnerable populations.’’ One aspect of the COPH efforts in this arena addresses the threat of climate change,\n                  of global warming’s impact on the atmosphere, oceans and land masses. As climate-fueled\n                  disasters become more frequent, they are causing more destruction, death and economic\n                  losses globally. In her American University lecture, Mehmood cites the various categories of disasters.\n                  Floods top the list as the most frequent and destructive; followed by draughts, severe\n                  storms, earthquakes and extreme temperatures, respectively. Part of the problem with\n                  recovering from these events is whether resources are available and can be delivered\n                  when and where people need them. In other words, the disaster itself is often only\n                  part of a larger problem that may include social, political and economic inequities. “We have seen a lot of climate-related disasters such as drought and crop failures\n                  but so is man-made famine,’’ she adds. “Because if you block humanitarian aid, then\n                  it becomes a different type of humanitarian emergency.’’  Return to article listing   College News   Amber Mehmood Welcome to the USF COPH news page.

Partnerships, such as  National Voluntary Agencies Active in Disaster , form a powerful alliance that significantly enhances disaster response efforts. From  hurricanes  to  wildfires , this collaboration leverages the unique strengths of each sector, creating a whole community approach that isn’t possible otherwise.  With their deep community roots and nimble operations, nonprofits often have the advantage of quickly deploying to a disaster, providing immediate aid and support to those affected. They can rapidly mobilize volunteers, distribute essential supplies and offer critical services like food and medical care.  In the federal government, the people who cultivate and sustain partnerships with voluntary organizations at the local and national level are FEMA’s Voluntary Agency Liaisons (VALs). These federal public servants nurture long-lasting, steadfast relationships with voluntary, faith-based and community-based organizations, foundations, philanthropic partners, state and other federal government agencies, to promote a unity of effort and adapt solutions to meet shortfalls and unmet needs.  The VAL’s “people first” approach play an integral role to avoid duplication of benefits and services and maximize the impact of combined efforts. The VAL network includes staff permanently stationed in each of FEMA’s 10 regions. This allows VALs to have a presence throughout the country year-round and to coordinate with organizations at a local level even during non-disaster times.  Recovery efforts following the  Texas Windy Deuce Fire  and the  Texas Smokehouse Creek Fire  demonstrate the importance of partnerships along with efforts by the American Red Cross that led to a successful wildfire mitigation program.  As the threat of wildfires increase across the country, the American Red Cross initiated a wildfire preparedness pilot program in the Texas Panhandle last year in  FEMA Region 6 . This pilot not only raised awareness but also led to tangible results, with homes saved during the most recent wildfires. In April 2022, the Red Cross collaborated with the Fritch Fire Department, the City of Fritch and Team Rubicon to conduct in-home wildfire preparedness visits in the community of Scott’s Acres in Fritch, Texas. Red Cross volunteers and partners went door-to-door to educate residents about wildfire preparedness and offer personalized strategies to create defensible space around their properties. During these visits, residents were also encouraged to sign up for a  local alert system , which would enhance their ability to receive timely warnings and evacuation notices in the event of a wildfire. Moreover, residents were provided with wildfire defense awareness education and a comprehensive checklist outlining essential actions to prepare for future wildfire occurrences. In total, 86 home visits were conducted through this pilot initiative, with 41 households receiving additional mitigation-clearing services. Fast forward to the recent wildfire, only two of the homes that received mitigation efforts were among those lost. Remarkably, the mitigation efforts carried out during the Red Cross-led pilot program played a pivotal role in saving 19 homes from the ravaging wildfires. These outcomes underscore the importance of community-led initiatives and collaborative partnerships in bolstering wildfire resilience. As we reflect on the success of this wildfire preparedness pilot, we see that it serves as a testament to the power of proactive planning and collective partner action in safeguarding communities against the escalating threat of wildfires.  The nation can coordinate large-scale operations through partnerships to streamline the response and recovery process. Together, we can make a difference and ensure a safer, more resilient future for all.  To learn more about partnerships with FEMA before, during and after a disaster, visit  Partnerships | FEMA.gov .  Would you like to take a brief survey regarding your experience with fema.gov?", "metadata": {"published_date": "Unknown", "author": "Unknown", "source": "Unknown"}}

See all EU institutions and bodies The Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC) is the core of the  EU Civil Protection Mechanism . It coordinates the delivery of assistance to disaster-stricken countries, including relief items, expertise, civil protection teams and specialised equipment. Operating 24/7, the ERCC ensures rapid deployment of emergency support and acts as a coordination hub between all EU Member States, the 10 additional participating states, the affected country, and civil protection and humanitarian aid experts.  The ERCC can help any country inside or outside the EU affected by a major disaster upon request from the national authorities or a United Nations body. A well-coordinated European response to natural hazards and human-induced disasters can prevent the duplication of relief efforts and ensure that assistance is tailored to the needs of those affected. To lessen the burden on contributing states, the Emergency Response Coordination Centre can liaise directly with the national civil protection authorities of the country in need. It can also financially support the delivery of civil protection teams and assets to the affected country. EU Civil Protection Mechanism: 59 activations in 2024 A map of the world is shown, different types of crises are pinned on the map. The EU flag is at the right bottom. Types of crises: Floods, Wildfire, Outbreak, Tropical cyclone, Conflict, Marine incidents, Explosion, Repatriation, Earthquake, Landslide. The Emergency Response Coordination Centre has a fully staffed, 24/7 duty system to monitor global events and react to potential emergencies in real time, day and night. The centre manages a reserve of pre-committed assistance from EU Member States and participating states, such as emergency response teams or technical equipment, that can be immediately deployed in case of need. This reserve, known as the  European Civil Protection Pool , meets strict quality criteria guaranteed by an established certification process, ensuring a more efficient and coherent European disaster response. The centre can identify possible gaps in European assistance and propose how to cover these gaps through financial support from the EU.  Under the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, the Commission can co-finance operational costs, including transport costs. This enables the delivery of assistance to the country affected within a few hours with lower budgetary impact on those offering the assistance. In 2024, the Mechanism was activated 59 times to respond to, among other, (i) war in Ukraine and conflict in the Middle East; (ii) floods in France, Czechia, Poland, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Spain; (iii) wildfires in Europe and Latin America; (iv) tropical cyclone Chido in Mayotte. Since its launch, the centre has been continuously strengthened with enhanced operational, analytical, monitoring, information management and communication capabilities. The Emergency Response Coordination Centre improves coordination between civil protection and humanitarian aid operations, enabling real-time information exchange between EU Member States and relevant authorities.  It deploys skilled coordination and assessment teams composed of humanitarian aid and civil protection experts to conduct joint needs assessments. The centre ensures cooperation and coherence of EU action at an inter-institutional level, focusing on coordination mechanisms with the European External Action Service, the Council and EU Member States.  The ERCC also acts as a central 24/7 contact point when the solidarity clause is invoked. It provides emergency communications and monitoring tools through the Common Emergency Communication and Information System (CECIS), a web-based alert and notification application enabling a real-time exchange of information. In response to Russia’s war of aggression on Ukraine, the ERCC has been coordinating the EU’s largest emergency operation ever since the creation of the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. Through this operation, the EU has channelled millions of emergency items to Ukraine and the surrounding region. The centre operates  around-the-clock  and can deal with several emergencies in different time zones. It provides  improved coordination  between the Brussels-based EU institutions, national authorities in EU Member States, and other international partners. Since 2001, the ERCC has coordinated assistance  more than 770 times  in response to the activations of the EU Civil Protection Mechanism.

Climate change, it notes, made the floods twice as likely and nearly 10% more intense.   Although environmental protection laws in Brazil protect waterways from construction and limit land-use changes, they are not consistently applied or enforced, increasing people's and infrastructure's exposure to flood risks.    \"Changes in land use have contributed directly to the widespread floods by eliminating natural protection and can exacerbate climate change by increasing emissions,\" Regina Rodrigues, a researcher at the Federal University of Santa Catarina in Florianopolis, who took part in the WWA study, told the  IFRC's Climate Centre . Climate change made the floods twice as likely and nearly 10% more intense In the state's capital city, Porto Alegre, the lack of a significant extreme flood event until recently led investments and maintenance in its flood-protection system to be reduced, leaving it to reportedly fail at 4.5 meters of flooding, a far cry from its stated capacity of 6 meters.   Rio Grande do Sul's governor, Eduardo Leite, has been criticized since the record-breaking floods for  cutting or altering  480 items of the state's Environment Code in 2019, the first year of his first mandate. Its budget to  combat natural disasters  was just 9% of what was initially promised, and by the end of April it had used 5% of what was available.   As residents tried to survive on donations arriving from across the country and around the world, they slept in emergency shelters set up in everything from soccer stadiums and shopping malls to schools and churches—and contemplated where they would be able to restart their lives now that not only their homes, but also much of the infrastructure of their towns and cities was gone.    Hospitals and health centers transferred patients and closed their doors as the water rose. By mid-May, more than 4,000 health-care workers in Porto Alegre were  unable to work  because of the floods, and several hospitals that were able to keep their doors open suspended elective procedures in order to focus on the emergency situation.    Eventually, the close quarters people were living in at shelters and the stagnant water surrounding them would result in the spread of a variety of communicable, vector-borne, and contact- and contamination-related diseases that would put even more pressure on the struggling public health-care system.   As of the end of June, 43 people in Rio Grande do Sul  died of leptospirosis , a bacteria-based disease spread by contact with contaminated animal urine and common in the aftermath of floods. The state registered 737 confirmed cases of the illness, which often infects people when contaminated water contacts the  eyes, nose, mouth, or broken skin—causing  flu-like symptoms, including fever, red eyes, muscle aches, and vomiting.   Experts  warned  that the loss of basic sanitation due to the floods could lead to an increased number of cases of illnesses related to the consumption of contaminated food and water, including Hepatitis A, typhoid fever, gastrointestinal viruses, and bacterial infections.   The rising flood waters, which sat stagnant across the state for days before beginning to drain, created ideal conditions for the propagation of insects, including the  Aedes aegypti  mosquito, which can transmit diseases such as Zika, chikungunya, and dengue, which Brazil is already suffering  record-breaking epidemics .   Venomous animals such as snakes, spiders, and scorpions have become more of a concern as they've been pushed out of their habitats and homes by the flood waters, as have mammals that could transmit rabies.    Close quarters in shelters have upped the chances of the spread of respiratory illnesses, including flu and COVID-19, leaving experts to reiterate the importance of vaccinating against both diseases as well as others with an increased chance of transmission due to the conditions residents of Rio Grande do Sul were left to live in following the disaster.   The lack of preparedness for climate-related flooding and its public health consequences is what has left experts baffled Brazil's federal, state, and municipal governments have attempted to keep up with the health-care necessities of the population since heavy rains affected  almost 95%  of the state's cities and  displaced 615,000 people . Its Ministry of Health sent Rio Grande do Sul an  extra 300,000 doses  of vaccines against tetanus, diphtheria, Hepatitis A and B, whooping cough, meningitis, rotavirus, measles, mumps, rubella and rabies. The lack of preparedness for climate-related flooding and its public health consequences is what has left experts baffled.   \"The devastating impact on human systems from such extreme events can only be minimized with sufficient adaptation, including well-maintained flood protection infrastructure and appropriate urban planning,\" Rodrigues said.    Forecasts and warnings of the floods were available nearly a week before they occurred, but neither reached all those at risk nor conveyed the severity of the situation. During a June 2022 municipal public hearing in Pelotas, a town in Rio Grande do Sul, ecologist  Marcelo Dutra da Silva, a professor at the Federal University of Rio Grande, warned that \"entire cities in Rio Grande do Sul will have to be moved\" because of the  state's lack of preparation  for the heavy rains and flooding he knew would come as a result of a study he conducted based on data dating back to 2013.   \"At some point, we're going to start seeing [flooding] in areas where water didn't reach as often before and we're going to remember what we're talking about here,\" he told the BBC. \"We can't prevent climate events from happening, because they will happen. But can we be more resilient to them? Yes. Maybe we can move people from the highest risk areas. It is possible to know where events will be most serious first.\"   Brazil's Congress and Senate have been  blamed for the tragedy  in Rio Grande do Sul and others expected to come as members vote to do away with conservation areas and Indigenous territories, both currently protected from extractive industries under federal law, as well as the environmental licensing law, which oversees these activities in areas that permit them.   Failure in both creating and implementing policies to prepare for climate-related flooding and other disasters have occurred at all levels of Brazil's government, keeping the consequences that follow, including the many related to public health, off the table. If the cause isn't addressed, the effects won't ever be on the agenda. Jill Langlois is an independent journalist based in São Paulo, Brazil.

While that support is provided through various agencies and departments, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) plays a predominant role and gives financial assistance to local relief activities through its Disaster Relief Fund (DRF). As severe storms become more common due to climate change, there will be an increase in the need for federal resources — which are also used to address other forms of emergencies, including earthquakes, chemical spills, mass violence, and pandemics. Here, we provide an overview of how federal disaster assistance works and what role the DRF plays in federal disaster spending. Climate and weather-related natural disasters are becoming increasingly frequent, endangering lives and extracting a significant economic cost. Since 2020, damages from climate and weather disasters have averaged  $141 billion per year  — a 47 percent increase from the prior decade and four times the cost of the 1990s. The average number of disasters that cause significant damages (those that cost at least $1 billion, adjusted for inflation) has also risen from about six events per year in the 1990s to 22 events per year over the last four years. When a disaster or emergency occurs, the local government is primarily responsible for overseeing the response and recovery operations. They use their own funds and assets to provide initial emergency response services, but if the situation is beyond the capabilities of the local government the state government may step in to provide additional assistance. When a presidential disaster declaration is issued by a state in need, federal aid provides uninsured losses and expenses. State and local governments are expected to contribute funds to the relief efforts, and the cost-sharing requirements vary by the type of assistance provided.    Upon approval of a major disaster declaration, the federal government can activate dozens of its agencies and departments to provide monetary assistance and deploy federal personnel as well as other resources. FEMA is the main agency responsible for activating, implementing and coordinating federal disaster efforts. Other federal agencies such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Defense, and the Small Business Administration may also provide assistance under certain circumstances.  The vast majority of federal resources go to preparing for and responding to natural disasters, such as hurricanes and earthquakes, but funds have occasionally been used for other types of emergencies like person-made disasters and biological hazards. For example, the federal government authorized nearly  $20 billion  through four different agencies in response to the September 11 terrorist attacks. During times of non-emergency, governments invest in a variety of activities including disaster planning and training, evaluation of hazards, and long-term recovery programs.  The federal government funds disaster response through  nearly 20 different agencies and departments . Each agency funds its own disaster-related programs from its appropriated budget amount, which may be supplemented with additional appropriations throughout the year.   FEMA, housed under the Department of Homeland Security, is the primary agency responsible for general disaster assistance and receives the largest amount of money for financing federal disaster relief activities through the DRF. Other agencies and departments coordinate responses to disasters that target specific populations. The DRF accounted for 55 percent of all  federal disaster relief funding in fiscal year (FY) 2023  to provide funding for the aftermath of more than 31 weather- and climate-related events (some funds were provided for disasters that occurred in 2021 and 2022). Most of the DRF is used for grants and other direct financial assistance to state and local governments and individuals. The Department of Agriculture and related agencies received the second largest amount, which was predominantly dedicated to producers who had suffered crop and livestock losses due to hurricanes, droughts, wildfires, and floods.  The DRF is funded through the appropriation process as a part of FEMA’s budget. Any unused balance is carried over to the next fiscal year. In the event of a major disaster, Congress is likely to provide supplemental funding if the DRF’s balance and current funding are not sufficient to cover costs in a given year. While annual appropriations help the government to budget for costs in advance, supplemental appropriations enable Congress to address unanticipated needs on an ad hoc basis. From FY 1993 to FY 2023, 68 percent of all appropriations for disaster relief has been provided through supplemental appropriations.   While the funding for and spending from the DRF can vary each year depending on the frequency and severity of disasters, there has been an increase in DRF funding and outlays, on average, over the last thirty years — particularly after 2005. From 1993 to 2004, DRF spending averaged $3.4 billion a year; spending has since increased to an annual average of almost $16 billion over the 2005 to 2023 period.   That increase in spending has been primarily driven by supplemental appropriations for a handful of severe disasters in the past several years. In particular, the relief efforts for hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, all of which hit the United States in 2005, accounted for 17 percent of DRF spending since that year (all hurricanes accounted for 57 percent of DRF outlays). The federal response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which authorized the use of DRF funds for certain types of unemployment compensation in addition to emergency assistance and medical treatment, also accounted for 39 percent of spending. Other severe events, such as wildfires, flooding, tornadoes, and earthquakes, also contributed to higher spending levels. In fact, FEMA has projected that the DRF would run out of funds before the year ends  ten times  since 2001. When that happens, the DRF enters a state of Immediate Needs Funding, in which it only continues life-saving, life-sustaining, and critical ongoing disaster operations. While the DRF constitutes a small portion of the federal budget, it is the single largest source of disaster spending by the federal government. Year-to-year appropriations have greatly fluctuated over time, given the difficulty of accurately predicting the timing and extent of disasters. However, the cost of disaster assistance has slowly increased and that trend is projected to continue due to changing climate conditions. As the nation faces increasing numbers of natural disasters and other unpredictable emergencies, lawmakers should consider methods to responsibly prioritize disaster needs in the budget. That way, limited federal resources can be effectively deployed to remedy the damage inflicted following a natural disaster.   Photo by Apu Gomes/Getty Images The primary deficit is the difference between government revenues and spending, excluding interest payments.

If lawmakers do not agree on raising or suspending the debt limit before the extraordinary measures are exhausted, there would be severe consequences.

Dorothy Sherwood \n                 Joint Task Force-Bravo Public Affairs  \n             Joint Task Force-Bravo and U.S. Agency for International Development along with 25 participates from El Salvador’s Civil Protection, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Public Works, Red Cross, National Police, firefighters, and more from emergency services came together for exercise Sentinel Watch at the El Salvador General Directorate of Civil Protection in Nejapa, El Salvador, May 21-22, 2024. Sentinel Watch is a tabletop exercise led by JTF-Bravo that focuses on how the U.S. military, USAID and a host nation will respond jointly to natural disasters that affect the Central American region. “This is our second opportunity to train with our El Salvadorian partners in the last 12 months,” said U.S. Army Maj. Jordan Legg, JTF-Bravo J9, Civil Military Operations director. “I am pleased to see that our efforts are expanding to include not only their national response agencies, but also the leaders at the municipal level.\" \n\n\n \n\n\n\n The first day of the exercise covered El Salvador’s law on how they respond to natural disasters and the request process for international humanitarian aid followed by JTF-Bravo’s capabilities. JTF-Bravo briefers were from the U.S. Army Forces Battalion, 612th Air Base Squadron, 1-228th Aviation Regiment, J-Staff, U.S. Southern Command’s Situational Assessment Team and Public Affairs. The unique capabilities JTF-Bravo can provide, if requested by the host nation during a natural disaster, are short notice deployments by the U.S. SOUTHCOM’s SSAT, who can identify U.S. military capabilities needed and available to support U.S. foreign disaster assistance led by USAID’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance. ARFOR’s Medical Detachment consists of medical, surgical and preventative health teams who are able to setup within a couple of hours to start augmenting medical operations and providing medical supplies. Additionally, the 1-228th AR’s UH-60L and HH-60L Black Hawks, and the CH-47F Chinooks can conduct medical evacuations, and search and rescue in austere locations using the helicopter’s 100-foot hoist, and disaster relief with the capability to transport over 19,000 pounds of humanitarian aid and equipment. Another important capability briefed was JTF-Bravo’s various engineering drones that can produce aerial imagery of mudslides to help emergency personnel to safely respond to this type of disaster. On day two of the exercise, the participants were split into three groups to work together through a scenario selected for this Sentinel Watch with El Salvador, which was one of the top natural disasters for the country — earthquakes.  “This area is known as the ‘Valley of the hammocks (Valle de las Hamacas)’ because of the frequent earthquakes,” said Jilma Maribel Lainez, head of the Department of Development and Human Talent for the El Salvador Ministry of the Interior and Territorial Development, General Directorate of Civil Protection. “Disasters are not natural that is why we have an umbrella of national actions to work together with our Joint Task Force-Bravo partners as a system with the same goal.” \n\n\n \n\n\n\n Earthquakes can trigger other events such as fires, mudslides and tsunamis. The three groups developed contingency plans on how El Salvador and JTF-Bravo can unite personnel and resources to respond to these various natural disasters.    \"It is through these efforts that we become colleagues in a common cause to mitigate suffering across Central America,” said Legg. Natural disasters in Central America are inevitable. Sentinel Watch highlights the importance of fulfilling U.S. SOUTHCOM’s enduring promise to its regional partners and continues to provide rapid support and services with JTF-Bravo.

AUSTIN – The Texas Health and Human Services Commission is urging health care facilities, child care operators and other providers to update their emergency response plans as the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season begins on June 1. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecasts a range of eight to 13 hurricanes in the Atlantic basin this season. Of those, four to seven are expected to be major hurricanes of Category 3 or higher. An average Atlantic hurricane season has three major hurricanes. “Experience has shown us that Texas weather can be dangerous and sometimes deadly,” said Stephen Pahl, deputy executive commissioner for the HHSC Regulatory Services Division. “Planning is paramount when it comes to severe weather, especially with vulnerable clients. That’s why it’s so important to have a current emergency preparedness plan that staff can implement quickly and effectively.” HHSC requires  long-term care providers  such as nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, hospices and state-regulated group homes to regularly prepare for natural disasters, including hurricanes and flooding. HHSC also requires acute health care facilities such as hospitals, dialysis centers and child care operations to maintain an updated plan and ensure staff are fully trained to implement it during a crisis. A complete emergency preparedness and response plan includes up-to-date information about: HHSC issues  guidance to providers  about updating their plans and encourages them to  visit the DSHS Texas Ready website (link is external)  for hurricane preparedness resources, including sample plans, supply checklists and more information on preparing for hurricanes and other emergencies.

The agency needs employees stationed all across the nation, from FEMA headquarters in D.C., to  FEMA’s 10 regional offices nationwide , to individual communities with declared disasters or other needs. FEMA is responsible for coordinating the government's response to disasters and emergencies. As disasters become more frequent and intense, additional support is needed in the field of emergency management. The agency offers different types of positions available for individuals who want to serve and help those impacted by natural disasters, emergencies and other crises. These positions can be classified into different types:  Each of these positions has its own unique characteristics and requirements, but they all have one thing in common: they allow you to serve your community during times of need.  Reservists  deploy to different locations across the country to help communities and disaster survivors, as needed. Because there isn’t a constant need for these positions all the time, Reservists are considered on-call and intermittent employees. Deployment expectations will vary based on disaster activity and position need.  Reservists are hired into a 2-year appointment that can be renewed, depending on Agency need. Reservists also have USERRA protections, which provides job protections when they are deployed on behalf of FEMA. Many Reservists maintain full-time jobs with other employers and deploy with FEMA when the need arises.  The Reservist program is organized into cadres based on the type of support they provide to a disaster. This can range from Information Technology (IT) to Environmental and Historic Preservation, to Safety. To learn more about the different cadres or open positions, visit  Cadres on FEMA.gov . A Reservist position may be a good fit for you if you're able to commit to a minimum of 120-days of availability for deployment, love to travel and enjoy working in a fast-paced and unpredictable environment.  Local Hires  are usually residents of an area affected by an incident who aid in the recovery of their community throughout the recovery process. These employees are hired into 120-day appointments and may be extended based on the needs of the disaster. FEMA's mission relies on Local Hire employees from diverse professional backgrounds to provide essential services to disaster survivors in their community and at call centers. FEMA’s full-time disaster workforce includes IM-CORE and IMAT Employees, whose primary responsibility is focused on disaster response or recovery in the field.  If you’re open to extensive travel and have experience in engineering, grants management, emergency management, data analytics, or other related fields this could be an excellent opportunity for you. Full-Time Disaster Support (IC-CORE)  employees are generally aligned to Regional or Headquarters offices and provide support to the disaster workforce through program management or support functions such as Human Resources or Logistics. These positions may have occasional travel requirements during steady state, but also may deployed in the field to support the disaster workforce, as needed. Employees are hired into 2-to-4-year appointments that can be renewed, depending on Agency need. Permanent Full-Time (PFT)  employees are hired through the  Title 5 competitive hiring process . PFTs are responsible for a wide range of tasks, including managing resources, overseeing governance and strategy, advancing disaster preparedness and readiness, and managing non-Stafford Act programs, such as the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). FEMA offers many different types of employment opportunities for those who want to make a difference in their community to help people prepare, respond and recovery from disasters. Whether you're looking for a full-time career or a flexible on-call position, there is a job for you at FEMA. Join our team and help us keep the communities around the nation safe and prepared for any emergency!  You can learn more and find available opportunities at  Career Paths on FEMA.gov .

Date Published: August 28, 2024 National Preparedness Month — also known as September Safety Month or Disaster Preparedness Month — is an annual campaign held in September. It is dedicated to empowering individuals, families, businesses, and communities with the knowledge and resources they need to respond to and recover from emergencies. Emergencies can happen when you least expect it.  Tornadoes  can erupt without warning, and wildfires can engulf communities, leaving only ashes in their wake.  Earthquakes ,  tsunamis ,  landslides ,  volcanoes ,  flooding , and  snowstorms  create unpredictable situations that leave disaster in their paths. The unpredictability of natural disasters reinforces the need for emergency preparedness, especially during National Preparedness Month. Beyond natural disasters, emergencies happen at home, work, or while traveling that require you to respond whether to save a life or lessen the severity of symptoms and complications. Some common emergencies you may need to respond to are as follows. Responding when minutes matter requires you to have not only the tools to respond, like  first aid kits , but also the skills, like  First Aid and CPR training . The origin of National Preparedness Month can be traced back to the tragic events and aftermath of September 11, 2001. Following these events, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) recognized the critical need for increased emergency preparedness. FEMA then collaborated with various partners to launch the National Preparedness Month campaign in 2004. National Preparedness Month gained momentum in 2006 when FEMA and the Ad Council developed the “Ready” campaign. The campaign offered powerful messaging and widespread reach, playing a significant role in educating and motivating Americans to prepare for emergencies. It contributed to the overall goal of National Preparedness Month. Since its start, National Preparedness Month has evolved into a collaborative effort among government agencies, nonprofits, schools, businesses, and communities. The combined efforts guarantee that everyone is included and part of a more significant effort to promote preparedness. During National Preparedness Month, events like emergency preparedness workshops, community emergency response drills, educational resources, and preparedness guides are available to help people better prepare. Here’s how you can get prepared during National Preparedness Month and be ready when disaster strikes. Knowing CPR and first aid helps you recognize the signs that someone needs help and the skills to tend to them. CPR and first aid training skills are important for individual and community emergency preparedness—these lifesaving skills allow you to make informed decisions and increase survival rates. During an emergency, CPR and first aid training help you in various ways. Being prepared for an emergency means not just knowing what to do but how to do it. Learn CPR and first aid this Preparedness Month so you’re ready for whatever emergency may arise. In recognition of National Preparedness Month, the American Red Cross  is hosting several LinkedIn Lives  focused on National Preparedness Month ideas. From  basic first aid  to  business continuity in a disaster , we’ve covered September Safety Month topics to help you get prepared during National Preparedness Month. National Preparedness Month is not just about individual preparedness — it’s about empowering a culture of readiness across communities. Preparing for disasters saves countless lives, speeds up people's recovery, and saves money. Here are a few National Preparedness Month ideas to get involved and empower a culture of readiness this September safety month. Together, we can build a more prepared and resilient nation, one National Preparedness Month at a time. Training Services is a division of the American Red Cross. Our mission is to advance lifesaving education so you are better to prepared. Our robust training curriculum includes CPR and AED, First Aid, Basic Life Support (BLS), Babysitting and Child Care, Lifeguarding, Water Safety and more.

Share sensitive information only on official, secure websites.\n                             About 577,000 people (20.2%) living in the 27 counties in North Carolina under a major disaster declaration after Hurricane Helene had high social vulnerability to disasters, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s  Community Resilience Estimates  (CRE). Those areas and one tribal area that also received a major disaster declaration suffered  catastrophic flooding , power outages, property destruction and loss of life due to Helene, which reached Category 4 intensity on September 26. Thousands of homes were destroyed, many of which were  not covered by flood insurance . One in four or 138,000 mobile homes in North Carolina were in counties under a major disaster declaration. Figure 1 shows the counties under a major disaster declaration. The darker the shading, the bigger the share of people at high social vulnerability living in those counties. Rural areas were hit particularly hard: 10 of the 27 counties were predominantly rural (counties with 80% or more of the population living in a rural area in the 2020 Census). The CRE  measures social vulnerability  to disasters based on 10 individual and household factors from poverty and education to age and broadband access. Populations with three or more of these components are considered at high social vulnerability. Hurricane Helene struck areas that may have a particularly difficult time recovering from the disaster. Counties in declared disaster zones tended to have higher shares of older adults, people with disabilities, and mobile homes than those outside the disaster areas. This analysis includes but separates Mecklenburg County, the most populous county in the disaster zone and home to Charlotte, North Carolina’s most populous city. Mecklenburg County received a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) major disaster declaration October 7. But it was separated from this analysis because its large population skews the percentages from rural, less populous counties that absorbed much of the  extreme, unrelenting precipitation . Figure 2 shows metrics of social vulnerability for counties with and without major disaster declarations. Mecklenburg County is represented separately. Counties with a major disaster declaration tended to have higher shares of adults age 65 and older. Outside of Mecklenburg County, 21.9% of adults in disaster counties were age 65 or older compared to 17.4% in other counties. \n Older adults are at increased risk of death and long-term consequences from hurricanes and other disasters. For instance, when Hurricane Florence struck North Carolina in 2018,  two out of every three deaths  were among adults age 60 or older, and nearly half of deaths were among those 70 and over. The Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) asks about  six disability types : hearing, vision, cognitive, ambulatory, self-care, and independent living difficulties. Respondents who report having any of these difficulties are considered to have a disability. Outside of Mecklenburg County, where rates of disability are comparatively low, 15.9% of people living in disaster counties were estimated to have a disability versus 13.5% of people in non-disaster counties. One in four or 138,000 mobile homes in North Carolina were in counties under a major disaster declaration. Mobile homes were more prevalent as a share of all housing units in counties with a major disaster declaration. Not including Mecklenburg County, which has very few mobile homes, about 15.4% of housing units in those counties were mobile homes compared to 12% in the rest of the state. Mobile homes are especially vulnerable to powerful winds and flash floods during hurricanes. Unlike most other forms of housing,  FEMA recommends evacuating mobile homes  and seeking shelter elsewhere.  The Census Bureau tracks social vulnerability to disasters through its Community Resilience Estimates program, which provides information on where people may have problems withstanding the impacts of the disaster. The CRE uses 10 components of social vulnerability to build a single metric for every neighborhood in the United States: Three or more components are regarded as high social vulnerability to disasters. The Atlantic Hurricane season is from June 1 through November 30. Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida Wednesday, causing major flooding throughout the state, knocking out power for millions and spawning multiple tornadoes. The Census Bureau will continue to monitor the impact of disasters on the nation's people and economy to help those who need to make data driven decisions.

I took myself trekking alone for several years across Southeast Asia: Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Myanmar, mostly out in remote villages. In time I found myself absorbed in the day to day lives of villagers, survival and the simpler things in life that brought safety, comfort and happiness.” Once John returned to the U.S. after his extraordinary travels, he began to search for various ways to tackle the challenges his own community was facing. “That is when I learned about the American Red Cross and the many lifesaving ways it helps individuals and communities,” he remembered. Shortly afterwards, John began his Red Cross journey in Contra Costa County in 2014 and currently serves in Alameda County. Since then, John has made tremendous strides in focusing on educating people about disaster preparedness. John recalls being the first volunteer team to serve the Oakland community when the Red Cross launched the national Home Fire Campaign in 2014. “I went out to knock on doors and share with residents the Red Cross’s offer of installing free smoke alarms,” he stated. John was tasked to install the smoke alarms in the area and his experiences doing so allowed him to develop a comprehensive training for the Home Fire Campaign that is now known as Sound the Alarm. “Red Cross National’s [Community Preparedness Program Manager] Elizabeth Bubel invited me to partner with her in developing the training for national implementation. As part of this, I flew to Virginia to feature in a five-part YouTube Sound the Alarm training series, still widely used today,” he commented. John’s dedication as a volunteer to build and strengthen partnerships has been crucial to fulfilling the Red Cross mission. John’s ability to connect with residents in their homes, thoroughly listen to their stories and concerns about natural disasters and local hazards, as well as educating Alameda County community organizations about life saving preparedness with Be Red Cross Ready prepare so you can protect presentations allows him to feel fulfilled in his role as a Red Cross volunteer. “That has been exceptionally so with Sound the Alarm: local fire departments and community organizations that have established access to communities that can be difficult to gain access to, yet are vulnerable to home fires and disasters, these community partners now hold annual Sound the Alarm events that I am fortunate to lead, organize and facilitate. I am also the Safety Quality and Effectiveness (SQE) coach, checking in with canvassing teams and those fulfilling in[1]home appointments for smoke alarms and home fire and earthquake safety information,” he stated. At least 2,167 lives have been saved since 2014 as a direct result of the Home Fire Campaign. “The after-action sidewalk debriefs with the teams are always inspiring,” John said. “A reserve firefighter volunteer shared how stunned she was after she saw how vulnerable the family her team visited was: no smoke alarms, no knowledge of what their family would do in an emergency and how effectively the team was able to support them.” “Individual and community needs for Red Cross preparedness are substantial and the progress, sometimes one person at a time, is deeply purposeful for the Red Cross, and very meaningful for me, every time,” John remarked.

The IAEA's Incident and Emergency Centre plays a vital role in preparing and responding to potential nuclear or radiological emergencies worldwide. (Photo: D. Calma/IAEA) Ahead of the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction on 13 October, we look at the role played by the IAEA’s unique Incident and Emergency Centre in preparing and responding to potential nuclear or radiological emergencies. The centre is staffed by 29 permanent experts with over 200 staff on standby in case of a major nuclear or radiological emergency, irrespective of the cause. The centre remains operational 24/7, ready to spring into full operational mode if a report is received and meets established criteria, such as the declaration of an emergency at a nuclear power plant. The centre is ready to respond and inform Member States and the public in any scenario that may be relevant for nuclear safety and security.  For example, on 1 January this year, at 07:10 UTC, a magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck Japan’s Ishikawa Prefecture. Just over an hour later, the Emergency Response Manager at the IAEA received a message via the Agency’s Unified System for Information Exchange in Incidents and Emergencies (USIE): six of Japan’s nuclear power plants had potentially been affected. Fortunately, no abnormalities were reported, detailed inspections were carried out by Japan to ensure that no plant functions had been compromised or damaged. At midday that day, an update was received from Japan that all nuclear power plants in the country were operating normally. This message was posted on USIE, and countries received the information within seconds.  The IAEA also promptly issued an update via social media, reassuring the public that it was in contact with Japanese authorities, there was no cause for concern, and monitoring would continue. This prompt notification, proactive dissemination of information, and continuous communication with the national authorities — even in the absence of public safety impacts, as in the example above — exemplify best practices in disaster risk reduction. These lessons have been honed through responses to past emergencies, such as the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident. “Over 1500 users from 173 Member States and 21 international organizations now rely on the IAEA’s platforms and systems for prompt notification and assistance in a nuclear emergency. Over the years, the IEC has been able to build up an agile, responsive system which can respond at short notice to any event,” said Carlos Torres Vidal, Director of the IAEA’s Incident and Emergency Centre. While major nuclear accidents are very rare, the potential for incidents or emergencies remains — especially as radiation sources are used in a variety of contexts, from medicine to industry. For example, earlier this year in Liberia, a radioactive source was discovered in a stormwater drain at the John F. Kennedy Medical Centre, the country's largest hospital. Prompt intervention by the IAEA prevented a potential radiological incident, allowing the hospital to continue its operations without disruption. Read the  full story . Disasters can also compound one another: for instance, an earthquake may hinder efforts to respond to a nuclear emergency. Identifying, classifying, and preparing for swift action in response to different hazard scenarios is critical. Like pandemics and natural disasters, nuclear and radiological emergencies recognize no borders, amplifying the need for international coordination and information sharing. A row of emergency response fire trucks stand ready for action as part of the national preparedness exercise “Valahia” in Romania in October 2023. (Photo: C. Torres Vidal/IAEA) The IAEA’s Incident and Emergency Centre (IEC) plays a pivotal role in helping countries fulfil their obligations under the international conventions on nuclear accidents. These conventions were established in the aftermath of the 1986 Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant accident, when the world recognized the need for a robust international framework for cooperation in the event of nuclear emergencies. The  Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident  ensures that countries rapidly share relevant information about nuclear accidents or radiological emergencies, minimizing the potential for transboundary radiological consequences. The  Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency  facilitates cooperation between countries and the IAEA to provide timely assistance during an emergency, aiming to protect lives, property and the environment. Established in 2005, the IEC serves as the global focal point for preparedness, event reporting, information sharing, and coordinated response to nuclear and radiological emergencies, regardless of their origin. At the heart of the IEC’s work is global coordination. Under the emergency conventions, the IEC mobilizes international experts and coordinates in-house IAEA efforts in preparedness and response. It also works closely with other international organizations, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), World Health Organization (WHO), and World Meteorological Organization (WMO), to support a coordinated response when required. The IEC provides 24/7 assistance to countries facing nuclear or radiological events, including security-related threats. Its central platform, the Unified System for Information Exchange in Incidents and Emergencies (USIE), allows countries to notify the IAEA and the international community of emergencies confidentially and securely. While mandatory reporting is required for emergencies with potential transboundary impacts, countries are encouraged to report smaller events as well, even if they pose no immediate public safety risk but may cause public concern. Through USIE, countries can access other vital IAEA tools, such as the International Radiation Monitoring Information System (IRMIS) for visualizing radiation monitoring data, as well as assessment and prognosis tools. These tools provide emergency managers with critical insights about the potential progression of a nuclear accident, allowing them to make informed decisions and take prompt protective actions. IRMIS helps emergency managers decide the right protective actions during a nuclear emergency by showing radiation data compared to pre-calculated safety levels ( Operational Interventional Levels , or OILs). For example, high radiation levels in a specific area might mean evacuation or sheltering is needed. This information is displayed using colour codes that clearly indicate the proper action, like evacuating affected areas, or asking people to shelter in place. The Reactor Assessment Tool allows the IAEA to explain the status of nuclear facilities, like power reactors, using simple language and color-coded diagrams. It receives safety data from IAEA counterparts in Member States, helping the IAEA send clear, timely updates to all countries and the public about the emergency situation. The IEC also maintains a Response and Assistance Network (RANET) made up of States Parties to the Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency that have identified and registered in RANET national assistance capabilities consisting of qualified experts, equipment and materials that could be made available to assist another State. In addition to its in-house tools, the IEC collaborates with other organizations that provide essential data during emergencies. For example, the WMO offers atmospheric dispersion predictions based on real-time meteorological data, while the WHO is ready to engage specialised medical capabilities in Member States to provide assistance in cases of injuries caused by the improper use of radiation sources. This cooperation ensures that countries have access to relevant information to respond effectively in an emergency, from weather patterns to support in mitigating the consequences of nuclear or radiological emergencies. In fact, the IEC provides the Secretariat for the Inter-Agency Committee on Radiological and Nuclear Emergencies (IACRNE), which coordinates the arrangements of all these organizations for preparing for, and responding to, a nuclear or radiological incident or emergency. Preparedness is essential in ensuring that the impacts from a nuclear emergency can be adequately mitigated. The IEC plays a key role in strengthening national preparedness by providing guidance and training for a range of professionals from around the world, including emergency planners, responders, regulatory staff, and public information officers. The centre also conducts Emergency Preparedness Review (EPREV) missions, which help countries evaluate and strengthen their national capabilities to respond to nuclear and radiological emergencies, aligning with international standards. Nuclear accidents are rare, partly due to the robust safety and emergency preparedness regime in place globally. The IAEA’s Incident and Emergency Centre, through its coordination efforts, training programmes, and international partnerships, plays a crucial role in maintaining this safety net. By fostering international cooperation and ensuring readiness at all levels, the IEC helps mitigate risks, ensuring that even in the face of disaster, effective responses are in place to protect lives and the environment.

Lindsay Peterson Lindsay Peterson , a research assistant professor in the School of Aging Studies, began her work on\n                  how older residents prepare for disasters after Hurricane Irma hit Florida in 2017.\n                  She will use the Community Foundation grant to work with older adult residents and\n                  their caregivers on disaster preparedness and development of the app in Sarasota,\n                  Manatee, DeSoto and Charlotte counties. “Hurricane Ian, in 2022, was more devastating than Hurricane Irma for older adults\n                  in southwest Florida, and it showed there is an urgent need to increase the level\n                  of disaster preparedness for older adults, particularly those with dementia and other\n                  chronic condition,” Peterson wrote in her application for the Community Foundation\n                  grant. “I learned from my earlier research that family caregivers of older adults know disaster\n                  preparedness is essential, but many do not prepare because their caregiving responsibilities\n                  use so much of their time and energy. However, many are open to using a computer-based\n                  tool,” Peterson added. As an example, Peterson said the app will provide information about the risk of storm\n                  surge or flooding that caregivers can use to tailor an evacuation or shelter-in-place\n                  plan for themselves and/or the person in their care. Storm surge and flooding often\n                  claim the most lives during a hurricane or tropical storm. The grant award is part of a larger effort to obtain needed funding for further development\n                  of the app, which will be available on computers and smartphones. Other grants awarded\n                  earlier by the College of Behavioral and Community Sciences and the Southern Gerontological\n                  Society, were used to develop the pilot version of the app. “I am very thankful to the Community Foundation of Sarasota for its generous support,”\n                  Peterson said. “The grant will help us design what I hope will be an essential resource\n                  for residents and their families and other caregivers. As we have seen with recent\n                  hurricanes that made landfall in southwest Florida, it is critical that residents,\n                  especially older Floridians with special needs, have all the relevant information\n                  they need to prepare for and respond to a potential disaster.” The Community Foundation of Sarasota County  is a public charity founded in 1979 by the Southwest Florida Estate Planning Council\n                  as a resource for caring individuals and the causes they support, enabling them to\n                  make a charitable impact on the community. With assets of $488 million in more than\n                  1,580 charitable funds, the Community Foundation awarded grants and scholarships totaling\n                  $40 million last year to support education, the arts, health and human services, civic\n                  engagement, animal welfare and the environment. Since its founding, the Community\n                  Foundation has granted more than $435.8 million to area nonprofit organizations thanks\n                  to the generosity of charitable individuals, families and businesses.

Find out more about how the EU helps Europeans recover from the effects of natural disasters. The frequency and intensity of natural disasters in Europe is increasing. Largely due to  climate change  and urbanisation, Europeans have had to deal with more extreme weather including heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, floods and storms in recent years. As the  European Environmental Agency  points out, global temperatures have been increasing, with 2023 being the warmest year in more than 100,000 years. In addition, Europe is the fastest-warming continent and temperatures are predicted to rise even further. This often results in extreme weather conditions, such as droughts and wildfires. For instance, the record drought of 2022 was aggravated by  wildfires  consuming 900,000 hectares in southern Europe - an area the size of Corsica. In 2023, wildfires burned an additional 500,000 hectares, primarily in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal. However, the impact of climate change is not limited to extreme heat: it has also led to severe flooding across Europe. In the past 30 years, floods have affected 5.5 million people in the EU, caused 3,000 deaths and more than €170 billion in economic damage. In 2021, floods in Germany and Belgium caused more than 200 deaths and €44 billion worth of damage. In 2023, the damage in Slovenia was estimated at 16% of the country's gross domestic product and the financial loss from storm Daniel in Greece was estimated at billions of euros. Devastating floods hit Austria, Czechia, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia in September 2024. These natural disasters do not only result in material damages and the loss of life, but also affect ecosystems, agriculture, water supplies, health, energy security, food security, infrastructure, tourism, and can cause threats to the economy and financial markets. When an emergency hits, the EU can activate its  Civil Protection Mechanism  in the first instance. It is a mechanism to organise and coordinate an emergency response between the participating states, which include all EU countries as well as 10 other European countries (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iceland, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Serbia, Türkiye, and Ukraine). The Civil Protection Mechanism offers on-the-ground logistical and operational support to improve prevention, preparedness, and response to disasters. Since 2021, the Solidarity and Emergency Aid Reserve (SEAR) merges two mechanisms to streamline the aid process, allowing for both faster and more flexible emergency efforts and for long-term recovery efforts: the former European Emergency Aid Reserve and the EU Solidarity Fund. During the revision of the EU’s long-term budget for 2021-2027, approved in 2024, the maximum budget for the SEAR was increased from €1.2 billion to €1.5billion. The Solidarity and Emergency Aid Reserve provides rapid financial response to all kinds of emergencies like natural disasters or humanitarian crises in EU countries or their neighbours. For example, it provided support to Türkiye after two earthquakes in 2020 and 2023. It can quickly disburse funds to help with immediate humanitarian aid and rescue efforts such as the provision of food, shelter, medical assistance, and transport and logistics, as well as reconstruction. Within the Solidarity and Emergency Aid Reserve, the  EU Solidarity Fund  (EUSF) offers more long-term financial support to EU countries or candidate countries mainly in the event of a major natural disaster such as a flood, forest fire, earthquake, storm or drought, or since 2020 a major public health emergency, such as the  Covid-19  pandemic. More than €8.2 billion has been paid out for various recovery efforts since the fund was set up in 2002. Flooding is the most commonly funded event while the largest amounts have been allocated for recovery efforts following earthquakes. Another tool for long-term recovery and reconstruction are funds from the  EU Cohesion Policy  to rebuild infrastructure, repair damaged public services, and improve disaster preparedness for future emergencies. Within the Cohesion policy, the  European Regional Development Fund  (ERDF) can provide support for infrastructure and the  European Social Fund  (ESF+) supports social recovery efforts such as training or psychological support. The  EU Cohesion Fund  is primarily used to invest in environment and transport in the less prosperous EU countries, but can be used to finance disaster prevention, recovery, and rebuilding in the covered sectors. While natural disasters can occur anywhere and anytime, the level of preparedness by countries and societies plays a crucial role in mitigating their impact. The EU has many policies and initiatives that aim to build resilience. Through the  European Green Deal , the EU aims to be climate-neutral by 2050 and tackle the global warming that drives many of the natural disasters. With tools such as the  EU Adaptation Strategy , the EU wants to become climate resilient. In October 2024,  Parliament approved  a  European Commission’s proposal  to mobilise the European Union Solidarity Fund to help Italy, Slovenia, Austria, Greece and France repair damages from extreme flooding and cyclones in 2023. A month earlier, MEPs had called for  more funding to strengthen EU preparedness  to respond to natural disasters and highlighted the need for urgent investment in flood management and flood risk prevention measures. Parliament called for faster allocation of money from the EU Solidarity Fund. In addition, the MEPs suggested that the future EU Cohesion Policy should focus on climate change mitigation and adaptation even more and that the Commission should present a European Climate Adaptation Plan. The flexible use of other EU funds can also offer relief in the aftermath of natural disasters. In December 2024, Parliament approved rules to allow the use of the European Regional Development Fund, the Cohesion Fund and European Social Fund Plus for  quick and flexible funding of recovery efforts . The rules will apply retroactively to offer help for natural disasters that have occurred after 1 January 2024. Additionally, Parliament also allowed the use of unspent money allocated for rural development to assist disaster-affected farmers, forest holders and small businesses active in agriculture and forestry.", "metadata": {"published_date": "Unknown", "author": "Unknown", "source": "Topics | European Parliament"}}

As a Federal agency, FEMA must comply with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act which requires Federal agencies to identify damaged and lost resources, as well as mitigate the loss of any resources removed with Federal money. FEMA requested that the National Park Service's Cultural Resource GIS Facility (CRGIS) develop a strategy to survey and evaluate cultural resources affected by this disaster in Louisiana, using GPS and GIS to expedite the Section 106 process. Additionally, GIS is being used as a form of mitigation, with the GPS data serving as a form of documentation, to be integrated with state data. This project is helping to provide a lasting methodology for the documentation of cultural resources for the Section 106 process and serves as a comprehensive test of the Cultural Resource Spatial Data Standards developed by CRGIS. Read the Historic Preservation Response Methodology  here . The importance of documenting historic resources lies in the heritage of a place. Documenting and surveying cultural and historic resources provides a more permanent understanding of the nation’s historic sites and large-scale resources. The initial purpose of documenting these resources serves as a preservation, planning, and problem-solving tool for local, tribal, state, and national communities.  CRSurveyor is a cultural resources collection and mapping tool used to survey, document, and inventory cultural resources. With three modules- Architecture, Archaeology, and Disaster Response- communities can collect data and survey historic properties and landscapes while complying with the National Data Transfer Standards and catalog information required for the National Register of Historic Places and National Historic Landmarks program.  CRGIS has offered technical assistance with the CRSurveyor application since its inception and partnered with the State, Tribal, Local, Plans & Grants division of NPS and the National Alliance of Preservation Commissions to create, maintain, and implement this tool for state, Tribal, and local government use.

August 8, 2024 — For the third year in a row, NOAA’s Office Response and Restoration (OR&R) and National Sea Grant College Program (Sea Grant) are partnering to support coastal communities to prepare for, respond to and recover from natural or human-caused disasters. A total of $791,395 in fiscal year 2024 federal funds is anticipated to support four projects over two years in Alaska, Connecticut, the Northern Gulf of Mexico region and South Carolina, focused on strengthening local disaster readiness and recovery in underserved communities.  OR&R’s Disaster Preparedness Program coordinates current operational capabilities and facilitates knowledge from across the National Ocean Service and NOAA to ensure that commerce, communities and natural resources can recover as quickly as possible from all hazards.  “The Disaster Preparedness Program is pleased to continue to support these projects in vulnerable coastal communities. While we cannot prevent disasters from happening, we can attempt to reduce their impacts. We believe these projects will provide the public with the additional resources needed to mitigate the impacts of potential coastal disasters,” said Kate Wheelock, Director of the Disaster Preparedness Program.  Through the Disaster Preparedness Program’s support and partnership with Sea Grant, the four projects will ensure coastal communities are better equipped to move through the preparedness cycle efficiently, safely and effectively. Each project will take an individualized and localized approach to disaster preparedness:   See the full project descriptions  on Sea Grant's website . “As a trusted partner and broker of information in local communities, Sea Grant is uniquely positioned to help communities address disaster preparedness challenges in thoughtful, collaborative ways,” said Jonathan Pennock, Director of the National Sea Grant College Program. “This partnership with the Disaster Preparedness Program brings together the expertise of both programs to meaningfully contribute to coastal community resilience.” In fiscal years 2022 and 2023, OR&R’s Disaster Preparedness Program and Sea Grant partnered on three and four competitively selected projects, respectively.

How many times in the past few years have you heard the term “historic event” or \"unprecedented times?\" Probably more than once, and that trend shows no sign of reversing. Natural disasters such as floods, tornadoes, and extreme heat coupled with man-made problems such as ransomware, chemical or biological attacks, and civil disorder can have devastating effects on individuals, communities and entire regions.  Disasters start and end at the local level, and the emergency management community is experiencing a rapidly evolving threat landscape. Driven by this dynamic environment, S&T is using a collaborative, all-hazards approach to support resilience, leveraging new technologies and integrating existing research and development from academic and government institutions.  From artificial intelligence automation to next-generation data management, S&T is working to harness technologies that will better prepare tomorrow's emergency managers. The emergency management (EM) threat landscape is evolving at an unprecedented pace due to challenges like climate change, urbanization, and technological advancements. This shifting landscape requires a dynamic and adaptable approach to EM. Current EM research and development challenges include: Every great undertaking has to start somewhere and for this, over the past year S&T partnered with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to execute Emergency Management of Tomorrow Research (EMOTR) to: Together, these efforts navigated the complexities of EM and AI to identify emerging trends, potential challenges, and strategic pathways to guide future investments based on current assessments and projected needs.   To date, EMOTR has identified AI-based technologies with a high probability of enhancing EM in the next decade: In addition, the EMOTR validation exercises held in 2024, in combination with findings from the landscape assessments and stakeholder input, resulted in recommendations for a next-generation EOC: The  Extreme Weather: Opportunities for Improved Preparedness and Resilience  report is built on an S&T and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) joint workshop hosted at the University of Oklahoma National Weather Center in February 2024 to examine policy, mission, science, and technology requirements to support homeland security, emergency management and public safety missions in the face of extreme weather. These ongoing discussions have brought together representatives from across S&T, DHS components, NOAA, and other federal agencies including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, U.S. Geological Survey and Environmental Protection Agency, academia, and state and local agencies working on extreme weather-related issues, and representatives and leaders of the federal weather science community.  Resilience across homeland security missions, systems and communities is of increasing importance as natural disasters, extreme weather, and climate change impact society. De-risking the impacts of these drivers on homeland security and public safety missions and operations requires better understanding of the rapidly evolving global and technological landscape, the accompanying suites of options and new approaches that may be possible, and recognizing surge capacity cannot be the sole approach available in a poly-crisis environment. Ensuring the nation’s homeland security and public safety relies on robust scientific weather, water, space, and climate information and technologies to solidify critical supply chains, infrastructure sectors, and community response. This effort focuses on understanding the state of extreme weather science (with an emphasis toward floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, extreme heat and wildfires), advances in observational technologies and networks, and the emerging domain of environmental intelligence necessary to develop proper risk mitigation strategies and better enable frontline operations. The importance of interagency partnerships in extreme weather is increasingly vital as the confluence of events has been leading to the amplification of impacts. Information from fuel loads of invasive species to existing burn scars or environmental hazards, coupled to the richness of scientific instrumentation, can offer new means to inform first responders and public safety missions in more relevant and specific ways.

It is available to all Allies and partner countries and can support them with both response and preparedness for natural and human-made disasters and other emergencies.  Search and rescue divers signal that they’ve recovered a simulated casualty during EADRCC exercise North Macedonia 21.  The EADRCC can support Allies and partners in a wide range of emergencies, from natural disasters, to acts of terrorism and other crises, all the way to collective defence situations. It has been an integral part of NATO’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic; NATO’s support to Ukraine’s civilian population throughout Russia’s war of aggression; the Alliance’s support to Türkiye following the 2023 earthquakes; the evacuation of NATO-affiliated Afghans and their families from Afghanistan in 2021, and many other natural and human-made disasters. \nIn an emergency, the affected NATO or partner country can request support via the EADRCC. The Centre disseminates requests for assistance, coordinates offers and enables the swift delivery of assistance, working in close contact with the civil protection authorities of Allies and partners. The EADRCC can also help generate military assistance in disaster response, where necessary, and it provides situational awareness to Allies and partners about the emergency at hand, helping them take well-informed decisions. In a crisis, the EADRCC coordinates closely with the NATO Military Authorities, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA) and other international organisations involved in emergency response. Between 2020 and 2023, the EADRCC played a key role in NATO’s support to Allies and partners in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. The EADRCC helped facilitate the transfer of medical supplies such as masks, gloves, disinfectant and ventilators to countries that requested assistance. In 2022-2023, the EADRCC was instrumental in NATO’s support for Ukrainian civilians affected by Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine. Through the Centre, Allies and partners helped Ukrainian refugees, trained Ukrainian paramedics in Ukraine, and provided ambulances and essential supplies to first aid facilities in Ukraine. In 2023, the EADRCC coordinated the Alliance’s support to Türkiye following devastating earthquakes that were the largest natural disaster in NATO’s history. Assistance was mobilised through civil and military means, and included shelter and other early support for survivors.   The EADRCC conducts regular capacity-building and training events in Allied and partner countries. These activities help to enhance national resilience through improved disaster preparedness and increase a country’s ability to manage incidents and crises – from disaster response to broader security challenges. The Centre has organised 19 major civil protection exercises, which take place roughly every three years; the most recent one took place in 2021 in North Macedonia.   The Centre is located at NATO Headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. It is staffed by a small team, but can be augmented substantially in a crisis. The EADRCC also relies on expertise from national civil experts, who can be called upon to provide advice in specific areas in the event of a major disaster.   The EADRCC was established in 1998 by the  Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council  (EAPC) to support NATO’s Allies and partners with civil emergency planning and response. Building NATO’s cooperation with partners in the area of emergency response was initially a Russian proposal, and an example of the fruitful cooperation that NATO and Russia once had in the interest of international security. Just a few days after its creation, the EADRCC was called upon to coordinate humanitarian assistance from EAPC countries to Kosovo refugees in Albania during the Kosovo war in the late 1990s. Throughout the years, the EADRCC’s mandate has been periodically extended to include possible response to  terrorist  attacks;  chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN)  incidents; and other emergencies. It has also been tasked to provide Allies, partners and the NATO Military Authorities with situational awareness about the evolution of crises and disasters, to help them take well-informed decisions. In 2009, the countries of the Mediterranean Dialogue (MD) and those of the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative (ICI) were given direct access to the EADRCC, followed by other partners across the globe in December 2011. The centre has been part of NATO’s response to a wide range of incidents, including the Ebola epidemic and the COVID-19 pandemic, refugee flows to Allied and partner countries, Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, and major natural disasters including hurricanes, forest fires, floods and earthquakes. Today, the EADRCC is a tool supporting all three of NATO’s core tasks: deterrence and defence, crisis prevention and management, and cooperative security.

People also expect vital infrastructure and services (telecommunications, evacuation routes, and first-response measures, to name a few) to be in place to reduce the impacts when disaster hits. In communities and countries around the world, humans—aided by traditional technologies such as physical-based flood models and numerical-based weather forecasts—meet these disaster management expectations as best they can. Increasingly,  studies show  that artificial intelligence (AI)  can build on   and supplement  these traditional technologies [ Sun et al. , 2020]. However, AI-based disaster management tools, like their non-AI counterparts, can fail. Furthermore, the complexity of some AI algorithms makes it difficult to pinpoint causes of failure. Transparency with respect to the data, training, evaluation, and limitations of AI for disaster management is therefore critical to ensure the safety and robustness of these tools. Transparency also cultivates trust among end users, including disaster management agencies, first responders, and individuals, enabling them to make informed decisions with confidence. Here we highlight examples of how AI is already contributing to disaster management and identify steps to foster transparency. Disaster management refers to strategies intended to offset the impacts of hazards. Traditionally, these strategies consider four phases of intervention: mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery [ Sun et al. , 2020] (Figure 1). Mitigation  includes actions taken well in advance of a disaster, such as purchasing insurance to minimize potential financial burdens and constructing barriers to hold back future flooding. Preparedness refers to actions taken as a disaster becomes imminent, including forecasting and monitoring its progress, preparing shelters, and stockpiling disaster supplies. The response phase covers actions taken during a disaster, such as providing humanitarian assistance and sending out search and rescue missions. Finally, the recovery phase refers to actions after most of the damage has occurred, including impact assessment, debris removal, and reconstruction. AI technologies, including machine learning (ML) algorithms trained to recognize patterns in data sets, are showing great promise for beneficial use in all four phases, even outperforming some traditional tools in terms of accuracy and efficiency. For mitigation, AI is being used to identify vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure and to inform urban planning. For example, the resilience technology company  One Concern  is combining AI with virtual representations (known as  digital twins ) of natural and built environments in Japan to visualize possible impacts of disasters on critical infrastructure, including power grids, roads, and airports. In Europe, the  DestinE  project is building digital twins of Earth systems and funding extensive ML development to better understand the effects of climate and  extreme weather events . Get the most fascinating science news stories of the week in your inbox every Friday. Using a different approach,  Gazzea et al.  [2023] applied AI to understand traffic during hurricanes (Figure 2), which can help urban planners strategically position sensors to capture traffic flow and enhance situational awareness during disasters. Researchers are also using AI to produce maps of landscape susceptibility (e.g., to landslides) to guide infrastructure development [e.g.,  Azarafza et al. , 2021]. AI can support preparedness by contributing to forecasts. For example,  AltaML  is training AI with data on historical fires, regional weather, and forest conditions to predict wildfires. In addition, the  European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts , enabled by additional funding from member states, runs and publishes  publicly available weather forecasts  using AI models from Google DeepMind ( GraphCast ), NVIDIA ( FourCastNet ), and Huawei ( Pangu-Weather ) and its own  Artificial Intelligence Forecasting System . Benefits of these algorithms include low computational costs and high accuracy; general disadvantages include the black box nature of AI-generated forecasts. Benefits of these algorithms include low computational costs and high accuracy with respect to global metrics and certain extreme weather events. General disadvantages include the black box nature of AI-generated forecasts: As AI models grow in complexity, it can become increasingly difficult to understand how they reach their decisions. Other uncertainties relate to how climate change will affect future weather regimes. More specific challenges that have been faced by Pangu-Weather, for example, include overly smooth forecasts, bias with greater lead time, and issues predicting tropical cyclone intensity [ Ben Bouallègue et al. , 2024]. However, the growing involvement of domain experts in developing data-driven forecasting models can help address shortcomings and expand forecasting capabilities. AI’s ability to detect and monitor hazards can also enhance preparedness. For example,  ALERTCalifornia and CAL FIRE  are using AI to recognize smoke and other fire indicators in the footage of 1,050 cameras distributed across California and to alert local fire departments, applications that are especially useful for monitoring remote regions. During its first 2 months of operation, the agencies’ system correctly identified  77 fires before they were reported via 911 .  Pano AI  is similarly applying AI to data from rotating ultrahigh-definition cameras, satellites, field sensors, and other sources to detect smoke rapidly. Detections  verified by human analysts  are then communicated to first responders, cutting response times to fires. During the response phase, AI can provide situational awareness and decision support for disaster management efforts. For instance, research has demonstrated the ability of AI to sift through geolocated social media posts and find clusters of emergency messages, which could help identify where response efforts may need to be prioritized [ Powers et al. , 2023]. In the Real-time Artificial Intelligence for Decision Support via RPAS Data Analytics ( AIDERS ) project, data collected by sensors on board remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) are being analyzed using AI to support actionable decisions for first responders in emergency situations. Following a disaster, AI can be used to detect differences in pre- and postdisaster aerial or satellite imagery to ascertain the extent of damages [e.g.,  Kaur et al. , 2023]. Humans must be able to evaluate the quality of AI-generated information before using it to make important decisions. Despite many positive examples, applying AI in disaster management also presents substantial challenges. One is understanding how models arrive at their results and thus whether they are reliable. Humans must be able to evaluate the quality of AI-generated information before using it to make important decisions. Often, however, end users are not provided information about how an AI model is trained and evaluated. Take  Google’s Android Earthquake Alert System , which for some parts of the world pools anonymized accelerometer data from individual Android phones onto Google servers, applies AI algorithms to detect seismic events, and triggers alerts if a seismic event meets or exceeds a magnitude of 4.5. During the 2023  Kahramanmaraş earthquake sequence  along the Türkiye-Syria border, however, reception of the alerts  was reportedly patchy , despite  circumstances  that should have enhanced its reliability: The largest earthquakes exceeded the magnitude threshold, there was a high density of Android users in the region, and at least early in the sequence, it is likely that many of these phones were stationary during the shaking as it occurred at night. A seeming  lack of transparency  from the company about how the system operates, how well it works, and how users responded to surveys about the system’s functionality following the event has raised concerns about the system’s reliability and about if and where it failed (i.e., during the training of the AI model, the detection of the seismic event, or the triggering of the alert). By contrast, the inner workings of other early-warning systems, such as the U.S. Geological Survey’s  ShakeAlert  system, which  relies on data from a network of seismometers  and issues alerts from a publicly accountable entity, are far more transparent. Sometimes, AI algorithms might not perform as expected because of deficiencies in the data used for training or as operational input. For example, biases in training data—related to, say, the selection of data collection sites [ McGovern et al. , 2024]—can distort model outputs. Or if  sensors are not sufficiently sensitive —to detect wildfires in remote or otherwise inaccessible regions, for example—an AI algorithm might miss signals, resulting in failures to warn residents. Because of the complexity of many AI systems, identifying points of failure is difficult, and potential risks may be hard to spot in advance. Another avenue by which AI is being applied in disaster management is in chatbots. By generating text (see, e.g., the  Strengthening Disasters Prevention approaches in Eastern Africa chatbot  from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), AI can provide guidance and decision support during disasters. However, AI chatbots can raise additional challenges if they “ hallucinate ”—that is, if they generate convincing but unreliable answers that could be misleading and even dangerous. Because of the complexity of many AI systems, identifying points of failure is difficult, and potential risks may be hard to spot in advance, especially for underinformed users. Thus, it is important for the developers of these tools to be transparent about the quality, suitability, accessibility, and comprehensiveness of data used in an AI model; about how the model, its components, and its training algorithm function; and about limitations in capability and applicability [ Mittelstadt et al. , 2019]. Furthermore, this  transparency must also be meaningful . In other words, the information provided to stakeholders should be complete and understandable to enable informed decisionmaking. AI developers should implement fail-safes (e.g., involving human oversight), consider the AI literacy of human end users (which affects their ability to interpret output information), and combat cognitive biases such as users’ tendency to rely too heavily on algorithms. Together, these approaches can ensure the safety and robustness of AI tools for disaster management, enhance trust in them, enable the replication of methods, and contribute to more efficient transfer of knowledge and capacity sharing among current and potential users of the technology. Two deliberate steps that academic researchers, companies, and others developing AI-based tools for operational disaster management can take to foster transparency include sharing comprehensive documentation and undergoing regular independent audits. Documentation such as open-access metadata, data sheets, and other publications should disclose the origins and characteristics of AI training data according to the  FAIR  (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) principles and should detail how these data have been processed. Considerations of data quality (including information about missing values or biases) and privacy, as well as ethical considerations such as whether the data are equitably shared, should also be documented. These approaches safeguard sensitive information and build public confidence in the resulting AI application. During training and evaluation of an AI model, it is important to follow best practices to ensure the  reproducibility and validity  of the model. Modeling methods, decisions, limitations, and ethical considerations should be disclosed and documented in a short file called a model card [ Mitchell et al. , 2019], which can be disseminated in publicly available materials on platforms such as GitHub and GitLab or in open-access journals. We advise using  white box  algorithms (e.g., causal trees) that are inherently interpretable or, if a higher level of complexity is necessary, combining black box models (e.g., deep neural networks) with explainability methods. Explainability methods help justify the recommendations, decisions, or actions of an AI model. Some of these methods provide a local explanation for why a decision was made for a single prediction, whereas others provide global insights into general model behavior [e.g.,  Mamalakis et al. , 2022]. For example, if a user wants to understand why an AI system provided a specific earthquake detection, a local explanation would suffice. If, however, the user wants to understand why an earthquake detection system repeatedly fails, a global explanation would have greater value. When an AI model is operationally deployed, it is important to convey its uncertainties and thresholds clearly to users. When an AI model is operationally deployed, it is important to convey its uncertainties and thresholds clearly to users. For instance, what level of uncertainty in the model output is tolerable, and what threshold must be crossed for an early warning of an earthquake or flash flood to be triggered? Also, what technical requirements (e.g., Internet connectivity) must be met for such a warning to be received? Finally, it is imperative for developers to conduct regular audits and public reporting of the AI systems they are designing and implementing. Independent evaluations using relevant performance metrics and benchmarks—supported by organizations such as the  U.S. Government Accountability Office  and the  U.S. Department of the Interior —should assess the effectiveness and fairness (the absence of bias in data and algorithms [see  Gevaert et al. , 2021]) of AI applications. Public reporting of findings promotes transparency and encourages continuous improvement. In addition to sharing comprehensive documentation and undergoing regular auditing, we emphasize the importance of integrating stakeholders and end users in the development of AI-based systems. Such multiparty and interdisciplinary collaboration is vital for disaster management, in which various groups must work harmoniously in critical conditions [ Kuglitsch et al. , 2022]. Through partnerships among AI researchers, natural hazard experts, disaster management experts, policymakers, and members of affected communities, AI development becomes more inclusive and responsive to diverse needs and more transparent to all levels of stakeholders. Within these partnerships, adoption of harmonized terminologies around disaster risk and AI—such as those produced by the  International Strategy for Disaster Reduction , the  United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction , and the  Focus Group on AI for Natural Disaster Management  (FG-AI4NDM, which has transitioned into the  U.N. Global Initiative on Resilience to Natural Hazards through AI Solutions )—can lead to clearer communication across disciplines. Furthermore, adopting policies at the national level (e.g.,  U.S. federal Executive Order 13960  on promoting trustworthy AI in the government) and regional level (e.g., the  European Union’s AI Act ), as well as standards at the global level (e.g., the technical reports produced by FG-AI4NDM), can help foster transparency. These steps toward collaboration and transparency—especially in the documentation, implementation, and public presentation of AI systems—are critical to the success of AI for helping at-risk communities worldwide through disaster mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery.

There is no cost to attend and free parking is available onsite. There is no rain date. The event offers attendees a chance to meet first responders and public safety experts in a fun, friendly environment where families can find a wealth of information and resources to promote emergency preparedness and help them “make a plan, build a kit, and stay informed” by visiting  PrepareDE.org . The first 500 people to complete an activity challenge can earn a free treat from  Kona Ice . Family Emergency Preparedness Day is sponsored by the  Delaware Emergency Management Agency  (DEMA),  Kent County Parks and Recreation ,  Kent County Department of Public Safety ,  Delaware State Fire School , and the  Delaware Division of Public Health’s Office of Preparedness . Previous event photos are available at the DEMA  FEP Day Photo Album on Flickr .   Kids of all ages can meet Smokey Bear (Delaware Forest Service) and Sparky the Fire Dog (Delaware State Fire School) or take a ride on the Jump on Over Mini-Train. The Camden-Wyoming Fire Company will demonstrate a live vehicle extrication to show how first responders can free occupants trapped in a car. Bayhealth Healthcare will conduct sessions on how to “Stop the Bleed” and Kent County EMS will provide “Hands Only CPR” training. The Delaware State Police will showcase its maritime scuba trailer, mounted patrol, and K-9 unit. Chesapeake Utilities and Delmarva Power trailers will demonstrate gas and electrical safety while the Division of Alcohol and Tobacco Enforcement invites the public to try its Impaired/Distracted Driver Simulator. The public can also explore heavy equipment and emergency apparatus from numerous local fire companies and EMS agencies, including ladder trucks, engines, ambulances, and the Christiana Care Life Net helicopter. \nNumerous public agencies and nonprofits will be on hand to inform the public about their many services and resources, including Dover Air Force Base, Delaware 2-1-1, DNREC (hazardous materials), DelDOT (drones), Delaware Office of Highway Safety, DPH Office of Animal Welfare, Delaware Animal Response, Dover/Kent MPO, Delaware Department of Corrections, Kent County Amateur Radio Emergency Services, St. Francis Hospital, YWCA, and many more (see list below). Launched in 2004,  National Preparedness Month  (NPM) is  FEMA ’s national annual preparedness outreach as part of FEMA’s  Ready Campaign . In conjunction with the  Ad Council , NPM aims to educate and empower Americans to prepare for and respond to all types of emergencies, including natural disasters and potential terrorist attacks. National Preparedness Month culminates on September 30 with National Preparedness Day. The 2024 theme is “ Start a Conversation. ” The importance of being prepared for emergencies is underscored by the  FEMA National Household Survey , an annual snapshot of how well families are prepared for disasters and emergencies. The 2023 responses indicated 51 percent of adults believe they were prepared for a disaster and 57 percent had taken three or more preparedness actions in the last year. The results offered both encouragement and a need to take more action: there was a large increase in the percentage of people who assembled or updated supplies, but also a large decrease in the percentage of people who signed up for alerts and warnings. Only 50 percent of respondents believed that preparing can help in a disaster and were confident in their ability to prepare.

The National Resilience Guidance (NRG) offers a unifying vision of resilience. It provides the principals and steps all communities and organizations can take to increase their resilience in every sector and discipline. The NRG strives to help everyone understand and fulfill their critical roles related to increasing national resilience with the goal of increasing community and national resilience. The  National Resilience Guidance : The National Resilience Guidance emphasizes that strengthening resilience requires a collective approach. A resilient nation is created and sustained through thriving communities with secure and adaptable social, economic, environmental, housing, infrastructure, and institutional systems. Addressing resilience from only one perspective or through only one resilience lens will not be successful. “To become a resilient nation will require all of us to work together - let’s dig in and get to work.” Deanne Criswell, FEMA Administrator. With the complexity of this topic and the need to create a truly whole community effort to increase resilience, we committed to engaging with a broad range of partners to inform development of the NRG. Throughout the drafting of the NRG, we conducted over 80 meetings with federal and non-federal partners. We also held multiple listening sessions, in virtual engagements and at conferences, with over 1,000 participants from across the whole community -- representing numerous disciplines, sectors, levels of government, communities, and individuals. Through these discussions, we gathered input on a range of topics, such as what actions and partnerships are needed to increase national resilience, the roles and responsibilities of the whole community, innovative approaches for successful resilience planning, and the resources needed to help the whole community understand and execute their roles. We are excited to release the NRG and grateful for the opportunity to partner with and learn from the many people who shared their expertise and contributed to the development of this guidance. We will continue to engage the whole community as we develop additional resilience resources. The Resilience Resources Gateway provides additional resources including a resource library and other materials that can be used to strengthen community and national resilience.

The DSRR program develops novel and reliable approaches for collecting scientific data and conducting real-time surveillance and research during public health threats (PHTs). The program also identifies research to be performed outside the scope of an emergency to protect workers in the future. The program worked to identify and evaluate strengths and gaps, incorporate lessons learned from recent responses such as COVID-19, and create goals and objectives for the future. The Strategic Framework will continue to evolve as the program adapts to meet future occupational safety and health demands for workers. In this framework, a PHT may include disasters such as infectious disease outbreaks, chemical spills, and natural disasters. A PHT can include anything from a small-scale to a large-scale incident involving multiple jurisdictions and federal agencies. Workers impacted by a PHT may include healthcare personnel, first responders, public health personnel, meat and poultry processing workers, farm workers, airline and airport personnel, public transportation operators and other passenger drivers, grocery and food retail workers, volunteers, and delivery drivers. An internal NIOSH steering committee consisting of scientists with varied subject matter expertise supports the DSRR program and created this framework. Their wide-ranging expertise ensures the program can address multiple topics including:  Workers impacted by PHTs often perform non-routine activities in uncharacterized, hazardous environments. They may encounter novel exposures or experience unexpected health effects, injuries, or impacts on mental health. These are in addition to the expected exposures based on routine PHTs, such as weather-related threats. There is frequently a pressing public health need to answer critical questions regarding the impact of PHTs and to determine the factors responsible for adverse health effects experienced by workers, whether acute or chronic.  Reliable scientific information is critical to emergency preparedness and response efforts, while protecting workers requires developing and using scientific information effectively. Multiple entities must coordinate to collect and disseminate high-quality data in a timely manner. Occupational safety and health research in the PHT environment should consider and address many unique challenges. These challenges include the following: The mission of the DSRR program is to provide quality data and evidence-based recommendations to decision-makers to guide approaches for collecting data and conducting research, and to create mechanisms for overcoming the associated logistical, technical, and administrative challenges encountered during a PHT.  DSRR Program Principles  Despite the growing awareness of the variety of ways that PHTs may impact worker safety and health, critical gaps remain in our understanding. Strengthening the base of scientific evidence- through research will allow the DSRR program to inform priorities and mitigation strategies and to develop occupational safety and health recommendations. \n\t\t\t\t\tThe Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 established NIOSH as a research agency focused on the study of worker safety and health, and empowering employers and workers to create safe and healthy workplaces.\t\t\t\t Languages  Language Assistance  Would you take a brief survey so we can improve your experience on our site?

Effective preparation and mitigation make our business more resilient and help our associates, customers and members, and communities thrive. Back to Top To enhance resilience and help respond to and mitigate impacts of disasters, our approach includes: Ensuring the well-being of our associates and their families Maintaining and restoring our operations to serve customers and members swiftly and safely Helping vulnerable communities build resilience before disasters and supporting impacted communities after disasters Back to Top Recognizing that disasters could adversely affect our business performance, 1    Walmart invests in disaster planning and preparedness, including risk assessments, business continuity and crisis management planning, and training. Additionally, Walmart supports communities’ disaster preparedness and resilience programs, focusing on disaster-prone areas with underserved populations. Our Global Emergency Management (GEM) team, staffed by Walmart associates with experience in law enforcement, meteorology, emergency management, and resilience planning, uses data to identify, assess, and manage events that could affect our operations, supply chain, or associates. For example: Our enterprise resilience process aims to equip Walmart's business units to respond to business disruptions and crises in an efficient and cohesive manner. The GEM team facilitates these efforts by engaging with and training business units to implement and update business continuity and crisis plans. We regularly test our crisis/incident management plans through mock scenarios and tabletop exercises; these exercises help us learn and identify improvements that we integrate into our plans. Our associates play a critical role in disaster planning and preparation and receive role-specific training in crisis management and business continuity planning, processes, response, and recovery procedures, including participating in hands-on preparedness exercises. Walmart also offers training and resources to help associates prepare themselves and their families for emergency or crisis situations. For example, we offer online training and resources on how to create a personal emergency plan, which includes establishing communication plans, building an emergency supplies kit, and setting a family meeting place. Because so many customers and members rely on Walmart for essential products and services—particularly in times of disaster—we prepare for potential disasters that could affect their safety and access to essential products and services. We keep them informed about events that may impact their area and stock essential products needed before, during, and after events. Our facilities also prepare to minimize disaster impact, enabling swift and safe resumption of operations. Example preparatory activities include: Walmart and the Walmart Foundation help support organizations working to help communities—particularly those at risk of being disproportionately impacted—prepare and become more resilient. Starting in FY22, the Walmart Foundation invested more than $3 million to help underserved communities—particularly in areas prone to weather-related disasters and where resources are not always available—build the capacity to respond to disasters more effectively and equitably. Initial learnings from those grants highlighted prospective areas for further focus, such as:  Seeing the potential positive impact of further disaster resilience initiatives, along with the federal designation of  Community Disaster Resilience Zones  (CDRZs) across the U.S., the Walmart Foundation made more than $3.5 million in additional disaster resilience grants in the past year. This fresh round of funding included grants to organizations including St. Bernard Project (read more about the Walmart Foundation’s support of SBP below),  Geos Institute , and the Urban Institute. The St. Bernard Project Resilience and Recovery Fellows Program—a Walmart Foundation-funded project from our 2021 Gulf Region investments—showed promising results. The program supported the placement of Fellows to assist local communities in applying for and receiving disaster preparedness and recovery funds. A Fellow working with the City of Lake Charles, Louisiana helped the city to  obtain a $40 million HUD Choice Neighborhoods Grant  in 2023 to support the city’s recovery and rebuilding efforts after four natural disasters hit in the course of a single year.  Following on this success, the Walmart Foundation made an additional  $2 million grant to SBP  to support the appointment of additional Fellows working in communities in Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas. While each disaster and each community is unique, Walmart takes action to prepare our local store and club operators to be ready to meet community needs in a broad range of disasters. Walmart’s Disaster Response Guide provides foundational information about Walmart's community disaster support resources, including donating products and gift cards to nonprofits involved in recovery efforts, parking lot activations, and customer/associate giving campaigns. The Guide also provides best practices for store and club operators to foster relationships with local emergency managers, public officials, and community nonprofits ahead of any disaster, ensuring that our operators already have lines of communication open with these organizations. Back to Top   |   Back to Key Strategies and Progress When disasters occur, Walmart focuses on the well-being of associates and their families; recovering store and club operations swiftly and safely; and supporting impacted communities. Walmart’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) operates 24/7, 365 days per year and serves as the central command center for preparation and response. The EOC fields calls and reports of incidents every day from Walmart's stores, clubs, and facilities worldwide, including natural disasters and other events that could impact Walmart associates, operations, and communities. EOC team members assess and triage each situation, offer guidance to responding associates, and coordinate support. 2  The EOC can respond to events virtually or physically, assembling support teams around the clock. Depending on the nature of the disaster, the EOC can activate a cross-functional team to coordinate store and club operations, supply chain, human resources, philanthropic, and other activities across the company. EOC team members are regularly deployed to local and state EOC locations, embedding onsite with local emergency managers, government responders, and other organizations to facilitate communication on the latest forecast and impacts, coordination of response and recovery efforts, priorities, and support needs. After each event, the GEM team conducts after-action reviews to identify lessons for continuous improvement. Valuable information and recommendations from after-action reviews are incorporated into our future disaster preparedness and response plans. Explore the gallery below to see examples of how Walmart supports associates, customers and members, and communities during a disaster activation: this example follows our response during Hurricane Ian in 2022. In the wake of a disaster, our GEM team works with our Facilities and People teams to check on the well-being of our associates and their families and connect them to resources they may need. Through OneWalmart.com, our associate-facing website, we provide recommendations and best practices for what to do before, during, and after a natural disaster or when a store experiences a security threat or other business disruption. Real-time updates are shared with associates by email, OneWalmart.com, and through an associate hotline, which is automatically updated and tailored to the caller’s work location.  Following a disaster, we conduct associate wellness checks, directly reaching out to associates in the most impacted areas to assess their well-being and connect them to resources. In situations where multiple Walmart locations are impacted, this outreach could include thousands of associates. Walmart provides evacuation assistance for associates who must leave their homes due to mandatory evacuation, as well as opportunities to work in nearby stores and clubs should their regular Walmart location temporarily close.   Customers and members rely on Walmart’s more than 10,500 stores and clubs for essential products and services during times of disaster, so we aim to restore operations swiftly and safely. Often, we are able to begin serving communities in need while response agencies are simultaneously working to establish relief operations. Recovery activities include: Walmart is often the first destination after a disaster, and we draw on our strengths as a retailer to support relief efforts. Often, communities need more than an open store or club, and we are also committed to helping meet those needs. Since FY2022, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation have provided more than $55 million in cash and in-kind for disaster preparedness, response, and relief efforts supporting communities around the globe, including more than $15 million in FY2024. 3 Because each disaster is unique, our Walmart.org and emergency management teams coordinate with response organizations on the ground and relay real-time information back to our EOC. We use this information to determine the level and nature of support needed, which can range from using our space to coordinate services and product donations (such as food and water), to fast and flexible-use gift cards to local nonprofits to enable them to immediately procure critical supplies, to major grants to relief organizations and community foundations. Disasters often disrupt utilities, leaving community members without access to basics like hot meals, warm water, and the ability to charge their phones. In some instances, Walmart is able to support access to these resources through parking lot activations. Walmart.org has provided grants to several nonprofits to launch a fleet of disaster response vehicles that can be deployed to disaster-struck areas, offering crucial services such as laundry facilities, showers, Wi-Fi and phone charging, and hot meals. These innovative mobile assets, which are now deploying to disaster areas around the U.S., swiftly respond and set up in places like our parking lots, providing a place of comfort and resources for community members.

Back to Top   |   Back to Key Strategies and Progress 1. As stated in Walmart’s annual report on Form 10-K. 2. Adapted from FEMA’s  National Response Framework 3. Walmart's donations toward disaster recovery and relief efforts fluctuate from year to year in response to the needs of our communities and the frequency and severity of disaster events. For example, FY2022 numbers were substantially elevated due to Walmart's contributions to COVID-19 response causes.

Simulation training stands out as a proactive approach to strengthening emergency preparedness, offering critical support for health care professionals to manage high-stress scenarios effectively. Helen Newberry Joy Hospital, in Michigan’s Eastern Upper Peninsula, partnered with the  Center for Advanced Medical Learning and Simulation  (CAMLS) at USF Health in Tampa to strengthen the hospital’s trauma unit surge capabilities. The hospital’s remote geographic location, limited resources and increased probability for severe weather pose challenges if a medical surge incident occurs. CAMLS trains health care professionals through realistic simulation experience. Individuals and teams learn and practice the necessary skills to respond efficiently to medical surge scenarios. Leaders at HNJH say the simulation-based training improved teams’ abilities to manage an influx of trauma patients, particularly in high-stress, low-resource situations common in a rural setting. The realistic scenario-based exercises allowed clinicians to practice and refine their response techniques, while interprofessional team training enhanced collaboration and communication. In addition, CAMLS training emphasizes the importance of continuous improvement through debriefing sessions, which has helped the hospital identify areas for improvement and integrate lessons learned into future practices. Haru Okuda, M.D., CEO and executive director of USF Health’s CAMLS, and Steven A. Vix, M.D., medical director of the trauma program at HNJH, discussed the simulation training experience during a session at the 2024 AHA Rural Health Care Leadership conference.

Because of this initiative, our futures will be safer and better; nothing is more important,\" he adds. “The MOU signing with LULAC this week is historic. It underscores our joint commitment to support the Hispanic community before, during, and after disasters. I’m hopeful this collaborative partnership will strengthen and last for years to come.” Latino communities face heightened disaster risks due to economic inequities, language barriers, and residence in areas prone to hurricanes, flooding, and wildfires. Industries with high Latino representation, such as agriculture and construction, are also heavily disrupted by disasters. The increasing frequency and severity of these events due to climate change magnify these vulnerabilities. \"I am elated that LULAC and FEMA are entering this unprecedented relationship at a time when climatic change is significantly impacting our environment,\"  says Jose Barrera, Chairman of the LULAC National Environmental Justice Committee. \"The increased frequency and catastrophic gravity of natural disasters compel Americans to join together and help ensure the safety and well-being of others across our nation, especially the most vulnerable and often most exposed to the destruction of natural disasters. This is the imperative of our time,\" adds Barrera. LULAC has a proven history of mobilizing aid during disasters, from Hurricane Maria in 2017 to recent crises like Hurricanes Helene and Milton in 2024. Its nationwide network has ensured timely assistance and equitable recovery for affected Latino families. FEMA will host regular meetings, provide culturally tailored disaster education, and promote youth leadership in disaster management. LULAC will share insights on challenges facing underserved communities, disseminate FEMA’s messaging, and advocate for equitable recovery efforts. Together, both organizations aim to build resilience and save lives. Palomares concludes with optimism: \"This agreement marks a transformative step toward fortifying our communities and saving lives. Latino families have too often been overlooked during disasters. This partnership changes that narrative.” With over 325,000 members across 33 states, LULAC’s grassroots network will be instrumental in reaching vulnerable communities. Together, FEMA and LULAC are setting a precedent for inclusive and effective disaster management.

Learn more \n         Disasters can strike with little warning, leaving very little time for last-minute preparations. Many people are responsible for taking care of others, and for some people, that commitment extends to furry or four-legged friends like pets, wildlife and service animals. For livestock owners and caretakers, the challenges are even greater, as these animals often have unique needs that are more difficult to meet.  The U.S. has nearly 2 million farms in the country and is the largest food-producing nation in the world, making disaster livestock preparedness paramount. Livestock preparedness is important for several reasons, including:  Proper preparation can make the difference between life and death for livestock during a disaster. Here's a few helpful tips to help you prepare your livestock ahead of a disaster.    In addition to severe disasters like hurricanes and flooding, conditions such as drought and extreme cold or heat are day-to-day health and safety concerns for animals under your care. You never want to be caught off-guard. Knowing the types of emergencies that could happen where you live and whether you need to make any specific preparations for them is an important first step to take. Learning what your hazards may be easier than you think. FEMA offers several resources to help people identify their biggest risks. You can download the  FEMA App  to learn more about different types of hazards and to receive alerts when your area is affected by one. Safety tips are available by texting PREPARE to 43362. You can also visit  the National Risk Index , an easy-to-use tool that shows which communities are most at risk to natural hazards. This will help you plan for risks that are most likely to impact your area.    Your animals need  an emergency kit  just like you do, but your livestock disaster preparedness kit should be reflective of the type of animals in your care. Here’s some items you should consider: You should review the kit regularly to ensure the contents are fresh.    During a disaster, officials may tell you to evacuate. Depending on the disaster and the stability of the shelter you have for your livestock, you may need to evacuate them.  First, determine where you will go. Do you have friends or relatives who are capable of housing livestock during the disaster? You can also consider fairgrounds or other livestock evacuation locations. Another thing you will need to do ahead of time is arrange how livestock will be transported. If you have no way to evacuate your livestock, there are some steps you can take to keep them safe.    If you are not home when a disaster occurs, it’s important to have a designated neighbor who can tend to your livestock, knows your evacuation procedure, knows where your emergency kit is and has your emergency contact information available.  Remember to contact local officials if you need assistance. During a disaster, teams such as the  National Animal Health Emergency Response Corps  have teams specializing in responding to disease outbreaks and other disasters that affect livestock, poultry, companion animals and wildlife. You may also visit  FEMA.gov/locations  to find your community leaders, including your local emergency management officials.  While protecting your livestock and farm animals depends on the weather event, having a plan in place will go a long way in keeping them safe.  For more information on how you can prepare pets, large animals or livestock for a disaster, visit the  U.S. Department of Agriculture website  or  Prepare Your Pets for Disasters | Ready.gov .

The simulated spilled fuel quickly spread to the water treatment facility, contaminating nearby water sources. The faux earthquake also disrupted critical operations, including communication systems and transportation networks, significantly impacting the base's functionality.   “Overall, I believe the exercise was highly successful,” said U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Jo’hnoi Lemonius, 60th AMW inspection team manager. “The goal was to train as we would operate in a real-world situation.

Emergency responders can learn more about infant feeding during emergencies and disasters. Mothers can continue to produce breast milk during times of physical and emotional stress. However, the release (or letdown) of breast milk can be affected by stress. Lactating women who are under stress may need support to encourage the letdown of milk. Keep breastfeeding women in close contact with their babies so they can nurse frequently.  Timely practical and emotional support can reduce stress related to infant feeding concerns. Because of the release of certain hormones, breastfeeding may even reduce stress for the mother and baby during challenging situations. Ready-to-feed infant formula (RTF) is the safest option for formula feeding during an emergency or disaster. This is because it does not need to be mixed with water and is available in sterile individual single-use containers. When powdered infant formula is the only option, extra care must be taken to ensure that it does not get contaminated.  Extra precautions include: Prepare powdered infant formula using the exact amount of water and formula listed on the container. Use the exact measurement of the scoop provided. Do not dilute infant formula. Too much water may not meet the nutritional needs of the infant. Too little water may cause an infant's kidneys and digestive system to work too hard and cause dehydration.  Use prepared infant formula within 2 hours of preparation and within 1 hour from when feeding begins. Discard any infant formula left in the bottle after feeding. Learn more about how to safely  prepare and store powdered infant formula  during emergencies. Powdered infant formula feeding requires  safe water  to  prepare the formula  and cleaning supplies to  clean bottles, nipples, and other parts . These resources may not be readily available in an emergency. Powdered infant formula cannot be made in advance without adequate refrigeration. These requirements can create difficulties for families using infant formula.  Breastfeeding is the safest way to feed a baby during an emergency. It provides the nutrients and infection protection that babies need. Infants unable to breastfeed or be fed expressed breast milk can be fed with RTF infant formula.  Unlike powdered formula, RFT does not require water to prepare. Some mothers may be unable to feed their baby at the breast or are feeding their baby expressed breast milk. For these mothers, learning how to  express milk by hand  can help them continue to provide breast milk to their child. Expressing milk by hand is preferred over using a breast pump when proper cleaning of pump equipment is not possible or when power is not available.   Relief staff can make sure a designated safe, private space is available for lactating women to express milk by hand. Lactation support should be available to teach mothers how to hand express milk, if needed.   Expressed breast milk can be fed to a baby in a disposable cup .  This is an option if water is not safe for cleaning bottles or nipples. Access to a refrigerator with electricity may be limited during a natural disaster. During an emergency, families should continue to follow CDC's guidelines for  proper storage and preparation of breast milk .  In a power outage, take these precautions to ensure frozen breast milk is safe.  Once milk has thawed, use it within 24 hours. Thawed milk cannot be refrozen. After 24 hours, throw out unused, thawed milk. When it comes to safe storage of breast milk, remember \"when in doubt, throw it out.\" Breast milk contains antibodies and other factors that boost immunity that can help protect infants from illness. This is true even if the lactating mother is ill with conditions such as the flu or diarrhea. When an infant is sick, the mother can usually continue to nurse or feed their baby expressed milk to keep them hydrated. In  rare exceptions , breast milk or breastfeeding is not recommended. Examples are when the  lactating woman is ill  with specific transmissible conditions or taking  certain medications . Breastfeeding mothers support their health and their baby's health by eating nutritious meals and snacks and drinking plenty of water. However, women who are hungry or have limited access to healthy foods are still able to breastfeed. Breast milk provides the appropriate number of calories and optimal nutrition to support the growth and health of the infant. Feeding infant formula instead of offering the breast will decrease a mother's milk supply and effect their ability to provide a full supply of breast milk to their infant. Relactation  is when a mother starts breastfeeding again after having stopped for some time, such as weeks or months. A mother may wish to relactate as a safe way to feed an infant during a natural disaster or disease outbreak.  Breastfeeding is a supply-and-demand process encouraged by nipple stimulation and milk extraction. A mother may be able to re-establish milk production by frequently stimulating her nipples by pumping, hand expression, and/or nursing directly at the breast.  Relactation depends on many factors. Support and careful monitoring by a lactation consultant or other breastfeeding specialist is important for mothers wishing to relactate.  Infants who are receiving human milk from a mother who is relactating must be carefully monitored to make sure the child is getting enough calories to have normal weight gain.

The wildfires spread with unprecedented speed and intensity, driven by high winds and severe drought conditions that created an increased amount of fuel to feed the flames. The size and scope of the devastation have further strained essential resources — including water supplies needed to combat the fires — leaving local governments grappling with significant challenges. As wildfires become more frequent and destructive due to prolonged droughts and extreme weather, read on for essential resources to help local governments prioritize not only immediate response efforts but also long-term recovery and resilience planning.  Elected officials coordinating emergency services during a disaster must navigate the complexities of aligning efforts across local, state and federal agencies to ensure an effective and unified response. Establishing clear communication channels — often through the city or county’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) — is crucial for disseminating information and coordinating actions. Familiarity with the  National Incident Management System (NIMS)  and the Incident Command System (ICS) is essential for integrating seamlessly with state and federal partners.  Officials must prioritize needs such as search and rescue, medical assistance, sheltering and infrastructure repair. Additionally, they must effectively coordinate the deployment of resources provided by state and federal agencies, ensuring these resources address the most pressing challenges. Some of the larger cities like  Los Angeles  maintain dedicated emergency management staff within an Office of Emergency Management or similar agency to prepare for, respond to and recover from disasters.  These professionals  develop emergency plans, conduct risk assessments and coordinate training exercises. During crises, they activate the city’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) to centralize decision-making, allocate resources and liaise with state and federal agencies like FEMA.  Local governments should consider leveraging mutual aid agreements with neighboring jurisdictions to strengthen firefighting and medical response capabilities. Mutual aid is a vital mechanism for disaster response and recovery, allowing communities to quickly mobilize qualified personnel and access specialized expertise and resources. These agreements are often facilitated through the  Emergency Management Assistance Compact , a legally binding framework among all U.S. states and territories. EMAC streamlines the sharing of personnel, equipment and services during governor-declared emergencies, supported by a robust governance structure and thorough pre-event preparation. Collaboration with the  state emergency management office  is vital for a coordinated and effective wildfire response and recovery. Aligning local emergency plans with state-level strategies enhances resource efficiency and prevents duplication. Partnering with the state office also grants access to disaster assistance programs, grants and resources for debris removal, infrastructure repair and long-term recovery projects. Establishing strong communication with the  FEMA regional office  is essential for effective disaster management. Regional offices serve as direct links to federal resources providing technical assistance, guidance and funding support. Close coordination helps streamline the application process for disaster declarations and grant programs, ensuring timely access to Individual and Public Assistance funds. FEMA regional offices offer expert advice on disaster planning, enabling local governments to integrate federal practices into their emergency response frameworks. Regular engagement with FEMA officials — through workshops, joint exercise and ongoing communication — enhances preparedness and facilitates a smoother response during wildfire emergencies. To qualify for federal disaster declarations and funding, it is crucial to conduct comprehensive damage assessments after a wildfire. This process involves assembling multidisciplinary teams to evaluate damage to infrastructure, homes and natural resources. Drones, GIS mapping and geotagged photos are used to thoroughly document destruction. Local governments must also assess economic impacts, gather feedback from affected residents and compile detailed reports that highlight the scale of destruction. A clear, data-driven case can help communities secure federal assistance for rebuilding while also providing valuable insights to enhance future disaster preparedness and resilience strategies. Local governments, businesses and individuals impacted by disasters can access a wide range of federal programs designed to support recovery, mitigation and preparedness. These programs offer financial aid, technical assistance and other resources to address the impacts of natural disasters and public health emergencies. Private and nonprofit organizations are vital partners in disaster recovery, offering unique resources, expertise and capabilities that complement public sector efforts. These organizations often provide critical services, including emergency housing, infrastructure repair and logistical support. Nonprofits play a key role in delivering humanitarian aid (food, water and medical care) while private companies contribute through technology (solutions, construction and telecommunications) to restore basic services quickly. Collaboration between these entities and local government agencies strengthens resilience and accelerates recovery efforts, helping communities rebuild and return to normalcy more efficiently after a disaster. These private organizations collaborate with NLC to support local government and offer the following resources to support disaster recovery: “The devastation and loss spurred by the ongoing wildfires in the Los Angeles area is absolutely heartbreaking. At the National League of Cities, our hearts are with the residents of all the communities impacted, with the first responders working hard to respond, and with the local leaders in the region as they guide their cities and towns through this tragedy. The disastrous impacts of these wildfires are a strong reminder of the role the federal government plays in delivering resources for all communities in the wake of increasing extreme weather events.”  – Statement from NLC President and Mayor Steve Patterson, Athens, OH NLC recognizes that every day, local leaders are on the frontlines of emergencies and disasters like the wildfires in Los Angeles.

On Saturday, February 8th, 2025, a 7.6 magnitude earthquake north of Honduras triggered a tsunami alert from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre (PTWC). Initially, several Caribbean nations were identified as potentially facing hazardous tsunami waves. While the threat was later downgraded and ultimately cancelled, the event serves as a crucial reminder that natural disasters can occur unexpectedly, even in our region. NEMA emphasises that being prepared is vital for safeguarding lives and property. Residents are encouraged to take the following steps to enhance their disaster readiness: • Stay Informed: Monitor official sources for updates and advisories from NEMA. Know  how to receive alerts in your area. • Develop a Family Emergency Plan: Discuss potential hazards with your family and  create a plan that includes evacuation routes, communication strategies, and a designated  meeting point. • Prepare an Emergency Supply Kit: Assemble a kit with essential items such as water,  non-perishable food, first-aid supplies, a flashlight, a battery-powered radio, medications,  and important documents. • Know Your Surroundings: Identify potential hazards in your community, such as floodprone areas or landslide-prone slopes. • Practice Drills: Regularly practice your family’s emergency plan, including evacuation  routes and procedures. “This recent event, while we are thankful it did not result in a tsunami impacting the shores of any territory, underscores the reality that we live in a region where various natural hazards are possible,” stated Livingston Pemberton, National Disaster Coordinator, NEMA. “We cannot afford to be complacent. I urge every resident of St. Kitts and Nevis to take disaster preparedness seriously. It’s not just about preparing for hurricanes; we must be ready for any eventuality. Being prepared can make all the difference in protecting ourselves, our families, and our communities.” NEMA remains committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of the people of St. Kitts and Nevis. The agency encourages everyone to visit its social media pages for more information on disaster preparedness and to stay informed about potential hazards. Individuals can also join NEMA’s Broadcast list by sending a message to (869) 466-5100 which is also used as the WhatsApp number.
