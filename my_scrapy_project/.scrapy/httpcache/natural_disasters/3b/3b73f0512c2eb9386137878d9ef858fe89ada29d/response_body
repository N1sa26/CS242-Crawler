Many businesses worldwide make the mistake of not preparing for disasters properly and are left to suffer the costly consequences. However, small business disaster preparedness planning is easier than you might think. We scoured the internet and interviewed risk management experts to bring you the best tips and resources so that you can finally check “disaster plan” off your to-do list.</p><div class="bdc-48q0hz-QtWrapper e193k8xj0"><div id="widget-embed"></div></div><section id="what-does-good-disaster-preparedness-look-like"><h2>What does good disaster preparedness look like?</h2><p>What does good disaster preparedness mean? We asked Frank Russo, managing director of commercial risk advisory firm Imperium Consulting Group. He told us an impressive story.</p><p>A large consumer goods retailer calls a standing meeting after every major natural disaster — even ones with no effect on their business, Russo shared. They discuss what they would have done if the disaster had happened at one of their locations. Russo explained that the company builds these brainstorming sessions into a regular “catastrophe gaming process” where employees act out disaster situations. The real-life stress tests identify weak points — for example, a door that can’t be locked because the facilities person is on vacation.</p><p>In 2008, Hurricane Ike caused a significant loss for this company in Houston. Still, it recovered quickly thanks to all its preparation — so quickly that Russo says it saw higher-than-normal sales after the hurricane. Why? It was one of the only businesses open in the area.</p><p>Many businesses faced disaster-preparedness crises in 2020 when the World Health Organization recognized the spread of COVID-19 as a pandemic — beginning a year-long health and economic struggle. The pandemic impacted businesses all over the world. While many shuttered their doors for good, some managed to survive and others thrived. The companies that were prepared and able to pivot quickly were likelier to remain in business.</p></section><section id="_4-steps-for-disaster-preparedness"><h2>4 steps for disaster preparedness</h2><p>Studies show that more than <a class="bdc-18rvtfr-LinkWrapper e2dct6e0" href="https://www.accesscorp.com/press-coverage/study-40-percent-businesses-fail-reopen-disaster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40 percent</a> of small businesses close permanently after a disaster.

This is your disaster plan coordinator. They decide how to develop the plan but you, as the business owner or manager, should be clear about what they must include. Here are some questions to consider when you assign this critical task.</p><p><strong>Does the plan coordinator need a supporting committee?</strong></p><p>If your business is large enough to have separate departments, the answer is probably yes. Each internal department will have its own unique assets, systems and requirements and you don’t want an outsider guessing what those might be.</p><p>Next, consider the entire scope of your operations. Do you ship hundreds of packages daily? If so, add a shipping company staff member to the supporting committee. Any vendor, supplier or government agency you use daily should be represented on your committee. They can explain their own disaster preparedness planning and how that will affect your post-disaster operations.</p><p><strong>What are the minimum elements your plan requires?</strong></p><p>Disaster plans aim to ensure the well-being of your employees, the stability of your location and your ability to keep the business running. You may need a 100-page guide or a simple series of reference sheets. Either way, your planning coordinator must understand the scope of your plan before they can properly develop it.</p><p>Your plan must address the following three goals, at the very least:</p><ol><li>Keep employees safe.</li><li>Secure dangerous objects and chemicals.&nbsp;</li><li>Keep your business running.</li></ol><p>These are the minimum viable elements of a disaster plan:</p><ul><li>An evacuation policy, including maps and routes</li><li>Who employees should contact, inside and outside the company, for additional information about what to do</li><li>Who is required to stay onsite to perform essential functions or shut down critical items</li><li>Who is responsible for rescue and medical duties</li><li>Employee emergency contact information, plus information about unique medical needs</li><li>Special instructions regarding hazardous materials and equipment, if necessary</li></ul><p><strong>What special circumstances does your plan need to address?</strong></p><p>Direct your plan coordinator to address any special circumstances related to your employees, your environment or your business operations. Here are some examples:</p><ul><li>An employee with mobility issues</li><li>An irreplaceable piece of equipment that requires maximum protection</li><li>A specific Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requirement for the storage of a particular chemical</li></ul><p>If you have <a class="bdc-18rvtfr-LinkWrapper e2dct6e0" href="/insurance/">business insurance</a>, this is an excellent time to <a class="bdc-18rvtfr-LinkWrapper e2dct6e0" href="/articles/looking-for-business-insurance-9-questions-to-ask-a-prospective-broker/">ask your insurance broker</a> or agent any questions you have. Do you know the monthly premium you pay? Part of what you’re paying for is access to your <a class="bdc-18rvtfr-LinkWrapper e2dct6e0" href="/insurance/risk-in-insurance/">insurer’s risk management</a> experts. They have seen the aftermath of disasters from coast to coast and can help you decide what to prioritize in your disaster planning.</p><p>Here are some other resources to help you build out your plan requirements:</p><ul><li><strong>Red Cross:</strong> <a class="bdc-18rvtfr-LinkWrapper e2dct6e0" href="https://www.readyrating.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ready Rating</a></li><li><strong>U.S. Chamber of Commerce:</strong> <a class="bdc-18rvtfr-LinkWrapper e2dct6e0" href="https://www.uschamberfoundation.org/disaster-preparedness-and-recovery-quick-guides/small-business-preparedness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Small Business Disaster Preparation Quick Guide</a></li><li><strong>FEMA Ready:</strong> <a class="bdc-18rvtfr-LinkWrapper e2dct6e0" href="https://www.ready.gov/business-impact-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Business Impact Analysis</a></li><li><strong>FEMA Ready:</strong> <a class="bdc-18rvtfr-LinkWrapper e2dct6e0" href="https://www.ready.gov/performance-objectives" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disaster Plan Performance Objectives</a></li><li><strong>IRS:</strong> <a class="bdc-18rvtfr-LinkWrapper e2dct6e0" href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/preparing-for-a-disaster-taxpayers-and-businesses" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Preparing for a Disaster</a></li></ul><section class="bdc-myy83k-TipBoxWrapper e1wiis6y7"><div class="bdc-s3qw18-Header e1wiis6y0"><div class="bdc-1bj2gra-HeaderContentWrapper e1wiis6y3"><span>FYI</span><svg width="30" height="30" viewBox="0 0 30 30" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-labelledby="bdc-did-you-know-icon-R2kpuiej96asd6"><title id="bdc-did-you-know-icon-R2kpuiej96asd6">Did you know</title><rect width="30" height="30" rx="15" fill="#E5FC56"></rect><g clip-path="url(#clip-R2kpuiej96asd6H1)"><path d="M14.64 10.8H16.56V12.72H14.64V10.8ZM14.64 14.64H16.56V20.4H14.64V14.64ZM15.6 6C10.3008 6 6 10.3008 6 15.6C6 20.8992 10.3008 25.2 15.6 25.2C20.8992 25.2 25.2 20.8992 25.2 15.6C25.2 10.3008 20.8992 6 15.6 6ZM15.6 23.28C11.3664 23.28 7.92 19.8336 7.92 15.6C7.92 11.3664 11.3664 7.92 15.6 7.92C19.8336 7.92 23.28 11.3664 23.28 15.6C23.28 19.8336 19.8336 23.28 15.6 23.28Z" fill="#000000"></path></g><defs><clipPath id="clip-R2kpuiej96asd6H1"><rect width="19.2" height="19.2" fill="white" transform="translate(6 6)"></rect></clipPath></defs></svg></div></div><div class="bdc-1479fiq-Body e1wiis6y1"><div class="bdc-19q5h0k-BodyContentWrapper e1wiis6y2"><div data-gtm="tip-box-content" class="bdc-151sq0q-ParsedContent e1wiis6y6">OSHA has several workplace safety regulations for businesses to comply with, regardless of disaster situations.

You’ll have action items as soon as your plan is complete. The idea is to identify things you can do now so you won’t have to do them in the days or hours before a natural disaster.</p><p>Here are a few examples.</p><p><strong>Evacuation routes and wardens</strong></p><p>Employees need to know where to go in case of an evacuation. Supply evacuation maps and post them in visible areas. Designate one or more individuals to ensure everyone gets out of the building safely — these folks are called evacuation wardens. OSHA <a class="bdc-18rvtfr-LinkWrapper e2dct6e0" href="https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/emergencypreparedness/gettingstarted_evacuation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommends you designate one warden for every 20 employees</a>.</p><p><strong>Disaster communications materials</strong></p><p>Approve emergency communications for employees, customers, suppliers and other stakeholders.

This <a class="bdc-18rvtfr-LinkWrapper e2dct6e0" href="https://www.redcross.org/get-help/how-to-prepare-for-emergencies/survival-kit-supplies.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Red Cross quiz can help you decide what to include.</a></p><p><strong>Training</strong></p><p>Every employee in your organization has a role during an emergency — even if it’s getting themselves out of the building safely. Your plan should identify which employees are responsible for which roles.</p><p>Businesses of all sizes should have a person or team responsible for business continuity and crisis communications. In a small company, this will be you, the owner:</p><ul><li><strong>Business continuity team:</strong> The business continuity team prepares the business to restart once it’s safe. This team also works with the insurance company to recoup losses caused by the disaster. The sooner you start making money again and the more you get back from your insurance company, the more likely your business is to survive.</li><li><strong>Crisis communications team: </strong>The crisis communications team is responsible for developing a <a class="bdc-18rvtfr-LinkWrapper e2dct6e0" href="/articles/effective-crisis-communication-strategies/">crisis communication strategy</a> and delivering crucial messages during a disaster.</li></ul><p>Here’s a sample training scheme:</p><p class="bdc-xi606m"><img alt="sample training scheme" loading="lazy" width="700" height="382" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6342" style="color:transparent" srcset="/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.business.com%2Fapp%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F03%2F23025955%2Ftraining-scheme-3.jpg&amp;w=750&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.business.com%2Fapp%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F03%2F23025955%2Ftraining-scheme-3.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.business.com%2Fapp%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F03%2F23025955%2Ftraining-scheme-3.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75"></p><h3>Step 4: Be a preparedness leader in your community.</h3><p>In a natural disaster, you may be at the mercy of your least-prepared neighbor. The unsecured restaurant patio umbrella that comes flying through your window or the hazardous materials that floodwaters carry into your parking lot might not be a threat if you were in charge of them, but you aren’t. And the longer your community takes to get back on its feet, the longer you’re likely to wait for business to ramp up again.</p><p>Communities often come together after a disaster, but it would be even better if they did so before the disaster happened.</p><p>Consider sharing your disaster preparedness plan to encourage other business owners and raise your profile in the community. Promoting your disaster preparedness efforts helps in these areas:</p><ul><li><strong>Hiring and retention: </strong>Promoting your disaster preparedness can help when you <a class="bdc-18rvtfr-LinkWrapper e2dct6e0" href="/articles/how-to-staff-business/">hire staff</a>. By showing prospective employees — and reminding current ones — that you take employee safety seriously, you encourage them to join and remain with your company.</li><li><strong>New business acquisition: </strong>Talking about disaster preparedness is a way to <a class="bdc-18rvtfr-LinkWrapper e2dct6e0" href="/articles/emotionally-connecting-with-customers/">connect with potential customers</a> and referrers that doesn’t require a sales pitch.</li><li><strong>Social media growth: </strong>Feel-good stories about your steps to keep the community safe can generate positive social media attention. Don’t be shy — you put in the work and deserve those likes and shares.</li></ul><p>Ready’s <a class="bdc-18rvtfr-LinkWrapper e2dct6e0" href="https://www.ready.gov/business-toolkit">Business Emergency Preparedness Social Media Toolkit</a> has sample messaging and graphics to work from.

In September 2017, Victoria Bennett and Claire Pearson had owned the store for five years without experiencing a single power outage. But as Hurricane Irma approached, they put their disaster plan into action.</p><p>They bought a generator and massive amounts of ice and collected coolers from neighbors. They moved all their backroom stock off the floor to protect it from flooding. They sent staff home, deciding to run the store themselves rather than risk employees’ safety.</p><p>Then, the power went out and it was time to get creative. With no way to run their credit card processors and cash registers and no light in the store, Bennett and Pearson were still able to sell beer, wine, bread and snacks using a cash bag and manual receipts.</p><p>“I think the neighborhood really appreciated that we were open,” Pearson said.</p><p>You never know how bad a disaster is going to be and you can’t control it. Maybe flooding would have forced Pearson and Bennett to evacuate. Maybe the power would’ve stayed on. But they were prepared, which let them pivot as the situation required. In the end, they formed a stronger bond with their customers.</p></section><section id="an-experts-take-what-you-should-do-right-now"><h2>An expert’s take: What you should do right now</h2><p>Russo advises Fortune 100 corporations about disaster planning. We asked him, “What do you tell friends who own small businesses when they ask what they should do?”</p><p>“At a minimum, have an inventory of what your assets are and make sure it’s up to date,” Russo advised. That’s something you could knock off in less than an hour.</p><p>Once you’ve done that, consider following the steps above to create an actionable plan for your business.</p><p>“Have an updated planning review session once per year,” Russo recommended. “Ideally, every quarter.”</p><p>The best action you can take, says Russo, is to weave disaster preparedness into the fabric of your business like the company in Houston did.</p><p>The true indicator of your disaster plan’s strength will be your business not only surviving the disaster but thriving during the recovery.</p></section><section id="sba-and-agility-recovery-disaster-checklists"><h2>SBA and Agility Recovery disaster checklists</h2><p>The SBA and Agility Recovery provide comprehensive checklists of things you should do in the days before a disaster is likely to strike.
